Act 1,Introduction,description,,"THE PLACE OF THE PLAY Various locations in
and around the City of London, including Scrooge’s
Chambers and Offices; the Cratchit Home; Fred’s
Home; Scrooge’s School; Fezziwig’s Offices; Old Joe’s
Hide-a-Way."
Act 1,Introduction,description,,"THE TIME OF THE PLAY The entire action of the
play takes place on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and
the morning after Christmas, 1843."
Act 1,Scene 1,description,,"[Ghostly music in auditorium. A single spotlight on Jacob Marley,
D.C. He is ancient; awful, dead-eyed. He speaks straight out to
auditorium.]"
Act 1,Scene 1,dialogue,Marley,"[Cackle-voiced] My name is Jacob Marley and I am
dead. [He laughs.] Oh, no, there’s no doubt that I am dead.
The register of my burial was signed by the clergyman, the
clerk, the undertaker . . . and by my chief mourner . . .
Ebenezer Scrooge . . . [Pause; remembers] I am dead as a
doornail."
Act 1,Scene 1,description,,"[A spotlight fades up, Stage Right, on Scrooge, in his counting-
house counting. Lettering on the window behind Scrooge reads:
“Scrooge and Marley, Ltd.” The spotlight is tight on Scrooge’s
head and shoulders. We shall not yet see into the offices and setting.
Ghostly music continues, under. Marley looks across at Scrooge;
pitifully. After a moment’s pause]"
Act 1,Scene 1,dialogue,Marley,"I present him to you: Ebenezer Scrooge . . . England’s most
tightfisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing,
wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old
sinner! secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.
The cold within him freezes his old features, nips his pointed
nose, shrivels his cheek, stiffens his gait; makes his eyes red,
his thin lips blue; and speaks out shrewdly in his grating
voice. Look at him. Look at him . . ."
Act 1,Scene 1,description,,[Scrooge counts and mumbles.]
Act 1,Scene 1,dialogue,Scrooge,"They owe me money and I will collect. I will have
them jailed, if I have to. They owe me money and I will
collect what is due me."
Act 1,Scene 1,description,,"[Marley moves towards Scrooge; two steps. The spotlight stays
with him.]"
Act 1,Scene 1,dialogue,Marley,"[Disgusted] He and I were partners for I don’t know
how many years. Scrooge was my sole executor, my sole
administrator, my sole assign, my sole residuary legatee,
my sole friend and my sole mourner. But Scrooge was not so cut
up by the sad event of my death, but that he was an excellent
man of business on the very day of my funeral, and
solemnized it with an undoubted bargain. [Pauses again in
disgust] He never painted out my name from the window.
There it stands, on the window and above the warehouse
door: Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to our
business call him Scrooge and sometimes they call him
Marley. He answers to both names. It’s all the same to him.
And it’s cheaper than painting in a new sign, isn’t it? [Pauses;
moves closer to Scrooge] Nobody has ever stopped him in the
street to say, with gladsome looks, “My dear Scrooge, how
are you? When will you come to see me?” No beggars
implored him to bestow a trifle, no children ever ask him
what it is o’clock, no man or woman now, or ever in his life,
not once, inquire the way to such and such a place. [Marley
stands next to Scrooge now. They share, so it seems, a spotlight.]
But what does Scrooge care of any of this? It is the very thing
he likes! To edge his way along the crowded paths of life,
warning all human sympathy to keep its distance."
Act 1,Scene 1,description,,"[A ghostly bell rings in the distance. Marley moves away from
Scrooge, now, heading D. again. As he does, he “takes” the light:
Scrooge has disappeared into the black void beyond. Marley walks
D.C., talking directly to the audience. Pauses]"
Act 1,Scene 1,dialogue,Marley,"The bell tolls and l must take my leave. You must stay a while
with Scrooge and watch him play out his scroogey life. It is
now the story: the once-upon-a-time. Scrooge is busy in his
counting-house. Where else? Christmas eve and Scrooge is
busy in his counting-house. It is cold, bleak, biting weather
outside: foggy withal: and, if you listen closely, you can
hear the people in the court go wheezing up and down,
beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their
feet upon the pavement stones to warm them . . ."
Act 1,Scene 1,description,,[The clocks outside strike three.]
Act 1,Scene 1,dialogue,Marley,"Only three! and quite dark outside already: it has not been
light all day this day."
Act 1,Scene 1,description,,[This ghostly bell rings in the distance again. Marley looks about him. Music in. Marley flies away.]
Act 1,Scene 1,description,,"[N.B. Marley’s comings and goings should, from time to time,
induce the explosion of the odd flash-pot, I.H.]"
Act 1,Scene 2,description,,"[Christmas music in, sung by a live chorus, full. At conclusion of
song, sound fades under and into the distance. Lights up in set:
offices of Scrooge and Marley, Ltd. Scrooge sits at his desk, at
work. Near him is a tiny fire. His door is open and in his line of
vision, we see Scrooge’s clerk, Bob Cratchit, who sits in a dismal
tank of a cubicle, copying letters. Near Cratchit is a fire so tiny as
to barely cast a light: perhaps it is one pitifully glowing coal?
Cratchit rubs his hands together, puts on a white comforter4
andtries to heat his hands around his candle. Scrooge’s Nephew
enters, unseen.]"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"What are you doing, Cratchit? Acting cold, are
you? Next, you’ll be asking to replenish your coal from my
coal-box, won’t you? Well, save your breath, Cratchit! Unless
you’re prepared to find employ elsewhere!"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"[Cheerfully; surprising Scrooge] A merry Christmas
to you, Uncle! God save you!"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,Bah! Humbug!
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"Christmas a “humbug,” Uncle? I’m sure you don’t
mean that."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"I do! Merry Christmas? What right do you have to
be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor
enough!"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"Come, then. What right have you to be dismal?
What reason have you to be morose? You’re rich enough."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,Bah! Humbug!
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"Don’t be cross, Uncle."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"What else can I be? Eh? When I live in a world of
fools such as this? Merry Christmas? What’s Christmastime
to you but a time of paying bills without any money; a time
for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer. If I
could work my will, every idiot who goes about with “Merry
Christmas” on his lips, should be boiled with his own
pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.
He should!"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,Uncle!
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"Nephew! You keep Christmas in your own way
and let me keep it in mine."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"Keep it! But you don’t keep it, Uncle."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"Let me leave it alone, then. Much good it has ever
done you!"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"There are many things from which I have derived
good, by which I have not profited, I daresay. Christmas
among the rest. But l am sure that l always thought of
Christmas time, when it has come round—as a good time: the
only time I know of, when men and women seem to open
their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them
as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not
another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And
therefore, Uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or
silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and
that it will do me good; and I say, God bless it!"
Act 1,Scene 2,description,,"[The Clerk in the tank applauds, looks at the furious Scrooge and
pokes out his tiny fire, as if in exchange for the moment of
impropriety. Scrooge yells at him.]"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"[To the clerk] Let me hear another sound from you
and you’ll keep your Christmas by losing your situation. [To
the nephew] You’re quite a powerful speaker, sir. I wonder you
don’t go into Parliament."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"Don’t be angry, Uncle. Come! Dine with us
tomorrow."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"I’d rather see myself dead than see myself with
your family!"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"But, why? Why?"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,Why did you get married?
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,Because I fell in love.
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"That, sir, is the only thing that you have said to me
in your entire lifetime which is even more ridiculous than
“Merry Christmas!” [Turns from Nephew] Good afternoon."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"Nay, Uncle, you never came to see me before I
married either. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"Good afternoon, Nephew!"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why
cannot we be friends?"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,Good afternoon!
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"I am sorry with all my heart, to find you so
resolute. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas,
and I’ll keep my Christmas humor to the last. So A Merry
Christmas, Uncle!"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,Good afternoon!
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,And a Happy New Year!
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"[He stands facing Scrooge.] Uncle, you are the
most . . . [Pauses] No, I shan’t. My Christmas humor is
intact . . . [Pause] God bless you, Uncle . . . [Nephew turns and
starts for the door; he stops at Cratchit‘s cage.] Merry Christmas,
Bob Cratchit . . ."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,"Merry Christmas to you sir, and a very, very happy
New Year . . ."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"[Calling across to them] Oh, fine, a perfection, just
fine . . . to see the perfect pair of you; husbands, with wives
and children to support . . . my clerk there earning fifteen
shillings a week . . . and the perfect pair of you, talking about
a Merry Christmas! [Pauses] I’ll retire to Bedlam!"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,[To Cratchit] He’s impossible!
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,"Oh, mind him not, sir. He’s getting on in years, and
he’s alone. He’s noticed your visit. I’ll wager your visit has
warmed him."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"Him? Uncle Ebenezer Scrooge? Warmed? You are a
better Christian than I am, sir."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,"[Opening the door for Nephew; two Do-Gooders
will enter, as Nephew exits] Good day to you, sir, and
God bless."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Nephew,"God bless . . . [One man who enters is portly, the other
is thin. Both are pleasant.]"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,"Can I help you, gentlemen?"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Thin Man,"[Carrying papers and books; looks around Cratchit to
Scrooge] Scrooge and Marley’s, I believe. Have I the pleasure
of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years. He
died seven years ago this very night."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Portly Man,"We have no doubt his liberality
is well represented by his surviving partner . . . [Offers his
calling card]"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"[Handing back the card; unlooked at] . . . Good
afternoon."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Thin Man,"This will take but a moment, sir . . ."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Portly Man,"At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge, it
is more than usually desirable that we should make some
slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly
at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common
necessities; hundreds of thousands are in want of common
comforts, sir."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,Are there no prisons?
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Portly Man,Plenty of prisons.
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"And aren’t the Union workhouses still in
operation?"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Thin Man,"They are. Still, I wish that I could say that they
are not."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"The Treadmil and the Poor Law are in full vigor, then?"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Thin Man,"Both very busy, sir."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"Ohhh, I see. I was afraid, from what you said at
first, that something had occurred to stop them from their
useful course. [Pauses] I’m glad to hear it."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Portly Man,"Under the impression that they scarcely furnish
Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude, a few of us
are endeavoring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat
and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time,
because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,
and Abundance rejoices. [Pen in hand; as well as notepad] What
shall I put you down for, sir?"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,Nothing!
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Portly Man,You wish to be left anonymous?
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"I wish to be left alone! [Pauses; turns away; turns
back to them] Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is
my answer. I help to support the establishments that I have
mentioned: they cost enough: and those who are badly off
must go there."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Thin Man,"Many can’t go there; and many would rather die.
Scrooge. If they would rather die, they had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population. Besides—excuse me—I
don’t know that."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Thin Man,But you might know it!
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"It’s not my business. It’s enough for a man to
understand his own business, and not to interfere with other
people’s. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon,
gentlemen!"
Act 1,Scene 2,description,,[Scrooge turns his back on the gentlemen and returns to his desk.]
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Portly Man,"But, sir, Mr. Scrooge . . . think of the poor."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"[Turns suddenly to them. Pauses] Take your leave of
my offices, sirs, while I am still smiling."
Act 1,Scene 2,description,,"[The Thin Man looks at the Portly Man. They are undone. They
shrug. They move to the door. Cratchit hops up to open it for them.]"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Thin Man,"Good day, sir . . . [To Cratchit] A merry Christmas
to you, sir . . ."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,Yes. A Merry Christmas to both of you . . .
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Portly Man,Merry Christmas . . .
Act 1,Scene 2,description,,[Cratchit silently squeezes something into the hand of the Thin Man.]
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Thin Man,What’s this?
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,Shhhh . . .
Act 1,Scene 2,description,,[Cratchit opens the door; wind and snow whistle into the room.]
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Thin Man,"Thank you, sir, thank you."
Act 1,Scene 2,description,,"[Cratchit closes the door and returns to his workplace. Scrooge is
at his own counting table. He talks to Cratchit without looking up.]"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"It’s less of a time of year for being merry, and more
a time of year for being loony . . . if you ask me."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,"Well, I don’t know, sir . . . [The clock’s bell strikes six
o’clock.] Well, there it is, eh, six?"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"Saved by six bells, are you?"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,"I must be going home . . . [He snuffs out his candle
and puts on his hat.] I hope you have a . . . very very lovely
day tomorrow, sir . . ."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"Hmmm. Oh, you’ll be wanting the whole day
tomorrow, I suppose?"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,"If quite convenient, sir."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"It’s not convenient, and it’s not fair. If I was to stop
half-a-crown for it, you’d think yourself ill-used, I’ll be bound?"
Act 1,Scene 2,description,,[Cratchit smiles faintly.]
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,"I don’t know, sir . . ."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"And yet, you don’t think me ill-used when I pay a
day’s wages for no work . . ."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,It’s only but once a year . . .
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"A poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every
25th of December! But l suppose you must have the whole
day. Be here all the earlier the next morning!"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,"Oh, I will, sir. I will. I promise you. And, sir . . .
Scrooge. Don’t say it, Cratchit."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,But let me wish you a . . .
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"Don’t say it, Cratchit. I warn you . . ."
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,Sir!
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge, Cratchit!
Act 1,Scene 2,description,,[Cratchit opens the door.]
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Cratchit,"All right, then, sir . . . well . . . [Suddenly] Merry
Christmas, Mr. Scrooge!"
Act 1,Scene 2,description,,"[And he runs out the door, shutting same behind him. Scrooge
moves to his desk; gathering his coat, hat, etc. A Boy appears at his
window . . . . ]"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Boy,[Singing] “Away in a manger . . .”
Act 1,Scene 2,description,,"[Scrooge seizes his ruler and whacks at the image of the Boy
outside. The Boy leaves.]"
Act 1,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"Bah! Humbug! Christmas! Bah! Humbug! [He shuts
out the light.]"
Act 1,Scene 2 Crossover,description,,"[A note on the crossover, following Scene 2:]"
Act 1,Scene 2 Crossover,description,,"[Scrooge will walk alone to his rooms from his offices. As he makes
a long slow cross of the stage, the scenery should change. Christmas
music will be heard, various people will cross by Scrooge, often
smiling happily.]"
Act 1,Scene 2 Crossover,description,,[There will be occasional pleasant greetings tossed at him.]
Act 1,Scene 2 Crossover,description,,"[Scrooge, in contrast to all, will grump and mumble. He will snap
at passing boys, as might a horrid old hound.]"
Act 1,Scene 2 Crossover,description,,"[In short, Scrooge’s sounds and movements will define him in
contrast from all other people who cross the stage: he is the
misanthrope, the malcontent, the miser. He is Scrooge.]"
Act 1,Scene 2 Crossover,description,,"[This statement of Scrooge’s character, by contrast to all other
characters, should seem comical to the audience.]"
Act 1,Scene 2 Crossover,description,,"[During Scrooge’s crossover to his rooms, snow should begin to
fall. All passers-by will hold their faces to the sky, smiling,
allowing snow to shower them lightly. Scrooge, by contrast, will
bat at the flakes with his walking-stick, as might an insomniac swat
at a sleep-stopping, middle-of-the-night swarm of mosquitoes. He
will comment on the blackness of the night, and, finally, reach his
rooms and his encounter with the magical specter: Marley, his
eternal mate.]"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"No light at all . . . no moon . . . that is what is at the
center of Christmas Eve: dead black: void . . ."
Act 1,Scene 3,description,,"[Scrooge puts his key in the door’s keyhole. He has reached his
rooms now. The door knocker changes and is now Marley’s face.
A musical sound: quickly: ghostly. Marley‘s image is not at all
angry, but looks at Scrooge as did the old Marley look at Scrooge.
The hair is curiously stirred; eyes wide open, dead: absent of focus.
Scrooge stares wordlessly here. The face, before his very eyes, does
deliquesce. It is a knocker again. Scrooge opens the door and
checks the back of same, probably for Marley‘s pigtail. Seeing
nothing but screws and nuts, Scrooge refuses the memory.]"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Pooh, pooh!"
Act 1,Scene 3,description,,"[The sound of the door closing resounds throughout the house as
thunder. Every room echoes the sound. Scrooge fastens the door
and walks across the hall to the stairs, trimming his candle as he
goes; and then he goes slowly up the staircase. He checks each room:
sitting room, bedrooms, lumber-room. He looks under the sofa,
under the table: nobody there. He fixes his evening gruel on the
hob, changes his jacket. Scrooge sits near the tiny low-flamed fire,
sipping his gruel. There are various pictures on the walls: all of
them now show likenesses of Marley. Scrooge blinks his eyes.]"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,Bah! Humbug!
Act 1,Scene 3,description,,"[Scrooge walks in a circle about the room. The pictures change back
into their natural images. He sits down at the table in front of the
fire. A bell hangs overhead. It begins to ring, of its own accord.
Slowly, surely, begins the ringing of every bell in the house. They
continue ringing for nearly half a minute. Scrooge is stunned by
the phenomenon. The bells cease their ringing all at once. Deep
below Scrooge, in the basement of the house, there is the sound of
clanking, of some enormous chain being dragged across the floors;
and now up the stairs. We hear doors flying open.]"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Bah still! Humbug still! This is not happening! I won’t
believe it!"
Act 1,Scene 3,description,,"[Marley’s Ghost enters the room. He is horrible to look at: pigtail,
vest, suit as usual, but he drags an enormous chain now, to which
is fastened cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy
purses fashioned of steel. He is transparent. Marley stands opposite
the stricken Scrooge.]"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,How now! What do you want of me?
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,Much!
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,Who are you?
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,Ask me who I was.
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,Who were you then?
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,"In life, I was your business partner: Jacob Marley."
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,I see . . . can you sit down?
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,I can.
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,Do it then.
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,"I shall. [Marley sits opposite Scrooge, in the chair across
the table, at the front of the fireplace.] You don’t believe in me."
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,I don’t.
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,Why do you doubt your senses?
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Because every little thing affects them. A slight
disorder of the stomach makes them cheat. You may be an
undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a
fragment of an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than
of grave about you, whatever you are!"
Act 1,Scene 3,description,,"[There is a silence between them. Scrooge is made nervous by it.
He picks up a toothpick.]"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,Humbug! I tell you: humbug!
Act 1,Scene 3,description,,"[Marley opens his mouth and screams a ghostly, fearful scream.
The scream echoes about each room of the house. Bats fly, cats
screech, lightning flashes. Scrooge stands and walks backwards
against the wall. Marley stands and screams again. This time, he
takes his head and lifts it from his shoulders. His head continues to
scream. Marley’s face again appears on every picture in the room:
all screaming. Scrooge, on his knees before Marley.]"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Mercy! Dreadful apparition, mercy! Why, O! why do you
trouble me so?"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,"Man of the worldly mind, do you believe in me,
or not?"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"I do. I must. But why do spirits such as you walk
the earth? And why do they come to me?"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,"It is required of every man that the spirit within him
should walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far
and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is
condemned to do so after death. [Marley screams again; a
tragic scream; from his ghostly bones.] I wear the chain I forged
in life. I made it link by link, and yard by yard. Is its pattern
strange to you? Or would you know, you, Scrooge, the weight
and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as 
heavy and long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have
labored on it, since. It is a ponderous chain."
Act 1,Scene 3,description,,"[Terrified that a chain will appear about his body, Scrooge spins
and waves the unwanted chain away. None, of course, appears. Sees
Marley watching him dance about the room. Marley watches
Scrooge; silently.]"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Jacob. Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak
comfort to me, Jacob . . ."
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,"I have none to give. Comfort comes from other
regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other
ministers, to other kinds of men. A very little more, is all that
is permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger
anywhere . . . [He moans again.] My spirit never walked
beyond our counting-house—mark me!—in life my spirit 
never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-
changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"But you were always a good man of business,
Jacob."
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,"[Screams word “business”; a flash-pot explodes with him.]
BUSINESS!!! Mankind was my business. The common
welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance,
benevolence, were, all, my business. [Scrooge is quaking.]
Hear me, Ebenezer Scrooge! My time is nearly gone."
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"I will, but don’t be hard upon me. And don’t be
flowery, Jacob! Pray!"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,"How is it that I appear before you in a shape that
you can see, l may not tell. I have sat invisible beside you
many and many a day. That is no light part of my penance. I
am here tonight to warn you that you have yet a chance and
hope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of my
procuring, Ebenezer."
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,You were always a good friend to me. Thank’ee!
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,You will be haunted by Three Spirits.
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Would that be the chance and hope you mentioned,
Jacob?"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,It is.
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,I think I’d rather not.
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,"Without their visits, you cannot hope to shun the
path I tread. Expect the first one tomorrow, when the bell
tolls one."
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Couldn’t I take ’em all at once, and get it over,
Jacob?"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Marley,"Expect the second on the next night at the same hour.
The third upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve
has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me no more. Others may,
but you may not. And look that, for your own sake, you
remember what has passed between us!"
Act 1,Scene 3,description,,"[Marley places his head back upon his shoulders. He approaches the
window and beckons to Scrooge to watch. Outside the window,
specters fly by, carrying money-boxes and chains. They make a
confused sound of lamentation. Marley, after listening a moment,
joins into their mournful dirge. He leans to the window and floats
out into the bleak, dark night. He is gone.]"
Act 1,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"[Rushing to the window] Jacob! No, Jacob! Don’t
leave me! I’m frightened! [He sees that Marley has gone. He
looks outside. He pulls the shutter closed, so that the scene is
blocked from his view. All sound stops. After a pause, he re-opens
the shutter and all is quiet, as it should be on Christmas Eve.
Carolers carol out of doors, in the distance. Scrooge closes the
shutter and walks down the stairs. He examines the door by which
Marley first entered.] No one here at all! Did I imagine all that?
Humbug! [He looks about the room.] I did imagine it. It only
happened in my foulest dream-mind, didn’t it? An
undigested bit of . . . [Thunder and lightning in the room;
suddenly] Sorry! Sorry!"
Act 1,Scene 3,description,,[There is silence again. The lights fade out.]
Act 1,Scene 4,description,,"[Christmas music, choral, “Hark the Herald Angels Sing,” sung by
an onstage choir of children, spotlighted, D.C. Above, Scrooge in
his bed, dead to the world, asleep, in his darkened room. It should
appear that the choir is singing somewhere outside of the house, of
course, and a use of scrim is thus suggested. When the singing is
ended, the choir should fade out of view and Marley should fade
into view, in their place.]"
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Marley,"[Directly to audience] From this point forth . . . I shall
be quite visible to you, but invisible to him. [Smiles] He will
feel my presence, nevertheless, for, unless my senses fail me
completely, we are—you and I—witness to the changing of a
miser: that one, my partner in life, in business, and in eternity:
that one: Scrooge. [Moves to staircase, below Scrooge] See him
now. He endeavors to pierce the darkness with his ferret
eyes.[To audience] See him, now. He listens for the hour."
Act 1,Scene 4,description,,"[The bells toll. Scrooge is awakened and quakes as the hour
approaches one o’clock, but the bells stop their sound at the hour
of twelve.]"
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"[Astonished] Midnight! Why this isn’t possible. It
was past two when I went to bed. An icicle must have gotten
into the clock’s works! I couldn’t have slept through the
whole day and far into another night. It isn’t possible that
anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!
[He runs to window; unshutters same; it is night.] Night, still.
Quiet, normal for the season, cold. It is certainly not noon.
I cannot in any way afford to lose my days. Securities come
due, promissory notes, interest on investments: these are
things that happen in the daylight! [He returns to his bed.]
Was this a dream?"
Act 1,Scene 4,description,,[Marley appears in his room. He speaks to the audience.]
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Marley,"You see? He does not, with faith, believe in me fully,
even still! Whatever will it take to turn the faith of a miser
from money to men?"
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Another quarter and it’ll be one and Marley’s
ghostly friends will come. [Pauses; listens] Where’s the chime
for one? [Ding, dong] A quarter past [Repeats] Half-past!
[Repeats] A quarter to it! But where’s the heavy bell of the
hour one? This is a game in which I lose my senses! Perhaps,
if I allowed myself another short doze . . ."
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Marley,". . . Doze, Ebenezer, doze."
Act 1,Scene 4,description,,"[A heavy bell thuds its one ring; dull and definitely one o’clock.
There is a flash of light. Scrooge sits up, in a sudden. A hand
draws back the curtains by his bed. He sees it.]"
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,A hand! Who owns it! Hello!
Act 1,Scene 4,description,,"[Ghostly music again, but of a new nature to the play. A strange
figure stands before Scrooge—like a child, yet at the same time
like an old man: white hair, but unwrinkled skin, long, muscular
arms, but delicate legs and feet. Wears white tunic; lustrous belt
cinches waist. Branch of fresh green holly in its hand, but has its
dress trimmed with fresh summer flowers. Clear jets of light
spring from the crown of its head. Holds cap in hand. The Spirit is
called Past.]"
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?"
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Past,I am.
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Marley,Does he take this to be a vision of his green grocer?
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Who, and what are you?"
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Past,I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,Long past?
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Past,Your past.
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"May I ask, please, sir, what business you have here
with me?"
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Past,Your welfare.
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Not to sound ungrateful, sir, and really, please do
understand that I am plenty obliged for your concern, but,
really, kind spirit, it would have done all the better for my
welfare to have been left alone altogether, to have slept
peacefully through this night."
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Past,"Your reclamation, then. Take heed!"
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,My what?
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Past,"[Motioning to Scrooge and taking his arm] Rise! Fly with
me! [He leads Scrooge to the window.]"
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"[Panicked] Fly, but I am a mortal and cannot fly!"
Act 1,Scene 4,dialogue,Past,"[Pointing to his heart] Bear but a touch of my hand here
and you shall be upheld in more than this!"
Act 1,Scene 4,description,,"[Scrooge touches the spirit’s heart and the lights dissolve into
sparkly flickers. Lovely crystals of music are heard. The scene
dissolves into another. Christmas music again]"
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past walk together across
an open stage. In the background, we see a field that is open;
covered by a soft, downy snow: a country road.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Good Heaven! I was bred in this place. I was a
boy here!"
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[Scrooge freezes, staring at the field beyond. Marley’s ghost
appears beside him; takes Scrooge’s face in his hands, and turns his
face to the audience.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Marley,"You see this Scrooge: stricken by feeling. Conscious
of a thousand odors floating in the air, each one connected
with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and care
long, long forgotten. [Pause] This one—this Scrooge—before
your very eyes, returns to life, among the living. [To audience,
sternly] You’d best pay your most careful attention. I would
suggest rapt."
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[There is a small flash and puff of smoke and Marley is gone
again.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,"Your lip is trembling, Mr. Scrooge. And what is that
upon your cheek?"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Upon my cheek? Nothing . . . a blemish on the skin
from the eating of overmuch grease . . . nothing . . . [Suddenly]
Kind Spirit of Christmas Past, lead me where you will, but
quickly! To be stagnant in this place is, for me, unbearable!
Past. You recollect the way?"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Remember it! I would know it blindfolded! My
bridge, my church, my winding river! [Staggers about, trying
to see it all at once. He weeps again.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,"These are but shadows of things that have been. They
have no consciousness of us."
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[Four jocund travelers enter, singing a Christmas song in four-part
harmony—“God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.”]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Listen! I know these men! I remember the beauty of
their song!"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,"But, why do you remember it so happily? It is Merry
Christmas that they say to one another! What is Merry
Christmas to you, Mr. Scrooge? Out upon Merry Christmas,
right? What good has Merry Christmas ever done you, Mr.
Scrooge? . . ."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"[After a long pause] None. No good. None . . . [He
bows his head.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,"Look, you, sir, a school ahead. The schoolroom is not
quite deserted. A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is
left there still."
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[Scrooge falls to the ground; sobbing as he sees, and we see, a small
boy, the young Scrooge, sitting and weeping, bravely, alone at his
desk: alone in a vast space, a void.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,I cannot look on him!
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,"You must, Mr. Scrooge, you must."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"It’s me. [Pauses; weeps] Poor boy. He lived inside his
head . . . alone . . . [Pauses; weeps] poor boy. [Pauses; stops his
weeping] I wish . . . [Dries his eyes on his cuff] ah! it’s too late!
Past. What is the matter?"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol outside
my door last night. I should like to have given him
something: that’s all."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,"[Smiles; waves his hand to Scrooge] Come. Let us see
another Christmas."
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[Lights out on a little boy. A flash of light. A puff of smoke. Lights
up on older boy]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Look! Me, again! Older now! [Realizes] Oh, yes . . .
still alone."
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[The boy—a slightly older Scrooge—sits alone in a chair, reading.
The door to the room opens and a young girl enters. She is much,
much younger than this slightly older Scrooge. She is, say, six,
and he is, say, twelve. Elder Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas
Past stand watching the scene, unseen.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Fan,"Dear, dear brother, I have come to bring you home."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Boy,"Home, little Fan?"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Fan,"Yes! Home, for good and all! Father is so much kinder
than he ever used to be, and home’s like heaven! He spoke so
gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed that I
was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come
home; and he said “yes” . . . you should; and sent me in a
coach to bring you. And you’re to be a man and are never to
come back here, but first, we’re to be together all the
Christmas long, and have the merriest time in the world."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Boy,"You are quite a woman, little Fan!"
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[Laughing; she drags at boy, causing him to stumble to the door
with her. Suddenly we hear a mean and terrible voice in the
hallway. Off. It is the Schoolmaster.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Schoolmaster,"Bring down Master Scrooge’s travel box at
once! He is to travel!"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Fan,"Who is that, Ebenezer?"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Boy,"O! Quiet, Fan. It is the Schoolmaster, himself!"
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[The door bursts open and into the room bursts with it the
Schoolmaster.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Schoolmaster,Master Scrooge?
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Boy,"Oh, Schoolmaster, I’d like you to meet my little sister,
Fan, sir . . ."
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,[Two boys struggle on with Scrooge’s trunk.]
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Fan,"Pleased, sir . . . [She curtsies.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Schoolmaster,"You are to travel, Master Scrooge."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Yes, sir, I know sir . . ."
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[All start to exit, but Fan grabs the coattail of the mean old
Schoolmaster.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Boy,Fan!
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Schoolmaster,What’s this?
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Fan,"Pardon, sir, but l believe that you’ve forgotten to say
your goodbye to my brother, Ebenezer, who stands still now
awaiting it . . . [She smiles, curtsies, lowers her eyes.] pardon, sir."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Schoolmaster,"[Amazed] I . . . uh . . . harumph . . . uhh . . .
well, then . . . [Outstretches hand] Goodbye, Scrooge."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Boy,"Uh, well, goodbye, Schoolmaster . . ."
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[Lights fade out on all but Boy looking at Fan; and Scrooge and
Past looking at them.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Oh, my dear, dear little sister, Fan . . . how I
loved her."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,"Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have
withered, but she had a large heart . . ."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,So she had.
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,"She died a woman, and had, as I think, children."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,One child.
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,True. Your nephew.
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,Yes.
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,"Fine, then. We move on, Mr. Scrooge. That warehouse,
there? Do you know it?"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,Know it? Wasn’t I apprenticed there?
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,We’ll have a look.
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[They enter the warehouse. The lights crossfade with them, coming
up on an old man in Welsh wig: Fezziwig.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Why, it’s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it’s
Fezziwig, alive again!"
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[Fezziwig sits behind a large, high desk, counting. He lays down
his pen; looks at the clock: seven bells sound.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,Quittin’ time . . .
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Fezziwig,"Quittin’ time . . . [He takes off his waistcoat and
laughs: calls off] Yo ho, Ebenezer! Dick!"
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[Dick Wilkins and Ebenezer Scrooge—a young man version—
enter the room. Dick and Ebenezer are Fezziwig’s apprentices.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Dick Wilkins, to be sure! My fellow-’prentice! Bless
my soul, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me,
was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Fezziwig,"Yo ho, my boys. No more work tonight. Christmas
Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer!"
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,[They stand at attention in front of Fezziwig; laughing]
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Fezziwig,"Hilli-ho! Clear away, and let’s have lots of room here! Hilli-
ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!"
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[The young men clear the room, sweep the floor, straighten the
pictures, trim the lamps, etc. The space is clear now. A fiddler
enters, fiddling.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Fezziwig,"Hi-ho, Matthew! Fiddle away . . . where are my daughters?"
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[The fiddler plays. Three young daughters of Fezziwig enter
followed by six young adult male suitors. They are dancing to the
music. All employees come in: workers, clerks, housemaids, cousins,
the baker, etc. All dance. Full number wanted here. Throughout the
dance, food is brought into the feast. It is “eaten” in dance, by the
dancers. Ebenezer dances with all three of the daughters, as does
Dick. They compete for the daughters, happily, in the dance.
Fezziwig dances with his daughters. Fezziwig dances with Dick
and Ebenezer. The music changes: Mrs. Fezziwig enters. She
lovingly scolds her husband. They dance. She dances with
Ebenezer, lifting him and throwing him about. She is enormously
fat. When the dance is ended, they all dance off, floating away, as
does the music. Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past stand
alone now. The music is gone.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,"It was a small matter, that Fezziwig made those silly
folks so full of gratitude."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,Small!
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,Shhh!
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,[Lights up on Dick and Ebenezer]
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Dick,"We are blessed, Ebenezer, truly, to have such a master
as Mr. Fezziwig!"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Young Scrooge,"He is the best, best, the very and absolute
best! If ever I own a firm of my own, I shall treat my
apprentices with the same dignity and the same grace. We
have learned a wonderful lesson from the master, Dick!"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Dick,"Ah, that’s a fact, Ebenezer. That’s a fact!"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,"Was it not a small matter, really? He spent but a few
pounds of his mortal money on your small party. Three or
four pounds, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves such
praise as you and Dick so lavish now?"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"It isn’t that! It isn’t that, Spirit. Fezziwig had the
power to make us happy or unhappy; to make our service
light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. The happiness he
gave is quite as great as if it cost him a fortune."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,What is the matter?
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,Nothing particular.
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,"Something, I think."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"No, no. l should like to be able to say a word or two
to my clerk just now! That’s all!"
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[Ebenezer enters the room and shuts down all the lamps. He
stretches and yawns. The Ghost of Christmas Past turns to
Scrooge all of a sudden.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,My time grows short! Quick!
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[In a flash of light, Ebenezer is gone, and in his place stands an
Older Scrooge, this one a man in the prime of his life. Beside him
stands a young woman in a mourning dress. She is crying. She
speaks to the man, with hostility.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Woman,"It matters little . . . to you, very little. Another idol
has displaced me."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,What idol has displaced you?
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Woman,A golden one.
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,"This is an even-handed dealing of the world. There is
nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is
nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the
pursuit of wealth!"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Woman,"You fear the world too much. Have I not seen your
nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-
passion, Gain, engrosses you? Have I not?"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,No!
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,"What then? Even if I have grown so much wiser, what
then? Have I changed towards you?"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Woman,No…
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,Am I?
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Woman,"Our contract is an old one. It was made when we
were both poor and content to be so. You are changed. When
it was made, you were another man."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,I was not another man: I was a boy.
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Woman,"Your own feeling tells you that you were not what
you are. I am. That which promised happiness when we were
one in heart is fraught with misery now that we are two . . ."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,No!
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Woman,"How often and how keenly I have thought of this,
I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it, and can
release you . . ."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"[Quietly] Don’t release me, madame . . ."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,Have I ever sought release?
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Woman,In words. No. Never.
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,In what then?
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Woman,"In a changed nature: in an altered spirit. In
everything that made my love of any worth or value in your
sight. If this has never been between us, tell me, would you
seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Ah, yes!"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,You think not?
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Woman,"I would gladly think otherwise if I could, heaven
knows! But if you were free today, tomorrow, yesterday, can
even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl—you
who in your very confidence with her weigh everything by
Gain; or, choosing her, do I not know that your repentance
and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With
a full heart, for the love of him you once were."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Please, I . . . I . . ."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,"Please, I . . . I . . ."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Woman,"Please. You may—the memory of what is past half
makes me hope you will—have pain in this. A very, very brief
time, and you will dismiss the memory of it, as an
unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you
awoke. May you be happy in the life that you have chosen for
yourself . . ."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,No!
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Woman,Yourself . . . alone . . .
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,No!
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Woman,"Goodbye, Ebenezer . . ."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,Don’t let her go!
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,Goodbye.
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,No!
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,[She exits. Scrooge goes to younger man: himself.]
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,You fool! Mindless loon! You fool!
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,[To exited woman] Fool. Mindless loon. Fool . . .
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Don’t say that! Spirit, remove me from this place."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Past,"I have told you these were shadows of the things that
have been. They are what they are. Do not blame me, Mr.Scrooge."
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,Remove me! I cannot bear it!
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[The faces of all who appeared in this scene are now projected for a
moment around the stage: enormous, flimsy, silent.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,Leave me! Take me back! Haunt me no longer!
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[There is a sudden flash of light: a flare. The Ghost of Christmas
Past is gone. Scrooge is, for the moment, alone onstage. His bed is
turned down, across the stage. A small candle burns now in
Scrooge’s hand. There is a child’s cap in his other hand. He slowly
crosses the stage to his bed, to sleep. Marley appears behind
Scrooge, who continues his long, elderly cross to bed. Marley
speaks directly to the audience.]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Marley,"Scrooge must sleep now. He must surrender to the
irresistible drowsiness caused by the recognition of what
was. [Pauses] The cap he carries is from ten lives past: his
boyhood cap . . . donned atop a hopeful hairy head . . .
askew, perhaps, or at a rakish angle. Doffed now in honor of
regret. Perhaps even too heavy to carry in his present state
of weak remorse . . ."
Act 1,Scene 5,description,,"[Scrooge drops the cap. He lies atop his bed. He sleeps. To
audience]"
Act 1,Scene 5,dialogue,Marley,"He sleeps. For him, there’s even more trouble ahead. [Smiles]
For you? The play house tells me there’s hot cider, as should
be your anticipation for the specter Christmas Present and
Future, for I promise you both. [Smiles again] So, I pray you
hurry back to your seats refreshed and ready for a miser—to
turn his coat of gray into a blazen Christmas holly-red. [A
flash of lightning. A clap of thunder. Bats fly. Ghosty music.
Marley is gone.] "
Act 2,Scene 1,description,,"[Lights. Choral music is sung. Curtain. Scrooge, in bed, sleeping,
in spotlight. We cannot yet see the interior of his room. Marley,
opposite, in spotlight equal to Scrooge’s. Marley laughs. He tosses
his hand in the air and a flame shoots from it, magically, into the
air. There is a thunder clap, and then another; a lightning flash, and
then another. Ghostly music plays under. Colors change. Marley’s
spotlight has gone out and now reappears, with Marley in it,
standing next to the bed and the sleeping Scrooge. Marley
addresses the audience directly.]"
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Marley,"Hear this snoring Scrooge! Sleeping to escape the
nightmare that is his waking day. What shall I bring to him
now? I’m afraid nothing would astonish old Scrooge now.
Not after what he’s seen. Not a baby boy, not a rhinoceros,
nor anything in between would astonish Ebenezer Scrooge just now. l can think of nothing . . . [Suddenly] that’s it!
Nothing! [He speaks confidentially.] I’ll have the clock strike
one and, when he awakes expecting my second messenger,
there will be no one . . . nothing. Then I’ll have the bell strike
twelve. And then one again . . . and then nothing. Nothing . . .
[Laughs] nothing will . . . astonish him. I think it will work."
Act 2,Scene 1,description,,[The bell tolls one. Scrooge leaps awake.]
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Scrooge,"One! One! This is it; time! [Looks about the room]
Nothing!"
Act 2,Scene 1,description,,[The bell tolls midnight.]
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Scrooge,Midnight! How can this be? I’m sleeping backwards.
Act 2,Scene 1,description,,[One again]
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Scrooge,"Good heavens! One again! I’m sleeping back and forth!
[A pause. Scrooge looks about.] Nothing! Absolutely nothing!"
Act 2,Scene 1,description,,"[Suddenly, thunder and lightning. Marley laughs and disappears.
The room shakes and glows. There is suddenly springlike music.
Scrooge makes a run for the door.]"
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Marley,Scrooge!
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Scrooge,What?
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Marley,Stay you put!
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Scrooge,Just checking to see if anyone is in here.
Act 2,Scene 1,description,,"[Lights and thunder again: more music. Marley is of a sudden
gone. In his place sits the Ghost of Christmas Present—to be
called in the stage directions of the play, Present—center of room.
Heaped up on the floor, to form a kind of throne, are turkeys, geese,
game, poultry, brawn, great joints of meat, suckling pigs, long
wreaths of sausages, mince-pies, plum puddings, barrels of oysters,
red hot chestnuts, cherry-cheeked apples, juicy oranges, luscious
pears, immense twelfth cakes, and seething bowls of punch, that
make the chamber dim with their delicious steam. Upon this throne
sits Present, glorious to see. He bears a torch, shaped as a Horn of
Plenty. Scrooge hops out of the door, and then peeks back again
into his bedroom. Present calls to Scrooge.]"
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Present,"Ebenezer Scrooge. Come in, come in! Come in and
know me better!"
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Scrooge,Hello. How should I call you?
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Present,I am the Ghost of Christmas Present. Look upon me.
Act 2,Scene 1,description,,"[Present is wearing a simple green robe. The walls around the room
are now covered in greenery, as well. The room seems to be a perfect
grove now: leaves of holly, mistletoe and ivy reflect the stage lights. Suddenly, there is a mighty roar of flame in the fireplace and now
the hearth burns with a lavish, warming fire. There is an ancient
scabbard girdling the Ghost’s middle, but without sword. The
sheath is gone to rust.]"
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Present,You have never seen the like of me before?
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Scrooge,Never.
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Present,"You have never walked forth with younger
members of my family: my elder brothers born on
Christmases past."
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Scrooge,"I don’t think I have. I’m afraid I’ve not. Have you
had many brothers, Spirit?"
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Present,More than eighteen hundred.
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Scrooge,"A tremendous family to provide for! [Present
stands] Spirit, conduct me where you will. I went forth last
night on compulsion, and learnt a lesson which is working
now. Tonight, if you have aught to teach me, let me profit
by it."
Act 2,Scene 1,dialogue,Present,Touch my robe.
Act 2,Scene 1,description,,"[Scrooge walks cautiously to Present and touches his robe. When
he does, lightning flashes, thunder claps, music plays. Blackout]"

audience.]"

through the city’s streets."

Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Marley,"See them there and hear the music people make when the
weather is severe, as it is now."
Act 2,Scene 2,description,,"[Winter music. Choral group behind scrim, sings. When the song is
done and the stage is re-set, the lights will fade up on a row of
shops, behind the singers. The choral group will hum the song they
have just completed now and mill about the streets,2 carrying their
dinners to the bakers’ shops and restaurants. They will, perhaps,
sing about being poor at Christmastime, whatever.]"
Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Present,"These revelers, Mr. Scrooge, carry their own dinners
to their jobs, where they will work to bake the meals the rich
men and women of this city will eat as their Christmas
dinners. Generous people these . . . to care for the others, so . . ."
Act 2,Scene 2,description,,"[Present walks among the choral group and a sparkling incense3
falls from his torch on to their baskets, as he pulls the covers off of
the baskets. Some of the choral group become angry with each
other.]"
Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Man #1,"Hey, you, watch where you’re going."
Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Man #2,"Watch it yourself, mate!"

Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Man #1,I pray go in ahead of me. It’s Christmas. You be first!
Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Man #2,"No, no. I must insist that YOU be first!"

Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Man #2,"The pleasure is equally mine, for being able to
watch you pass, smiling."
Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Man #1,"I would find it a shame to quarrel on Christmas
Day . . ."

Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Man #1,"Merry Christmas then, friend!"
Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Man #2,And a Merry Christmas straight back to you!
Act 2,Scene 2,description,,"[Church bells toll. The choral group enter the buildings: the shops
and restaurants; they exit the stage, shutting their doors closed
behind them. All sound stops. Scrooge and Present are alone
again.]"
Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,What is it you sprinkle from your torch?
Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Present,Kindness.
Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,"Do you sprinkle your kindness on any particular
people or on all people?"
Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Present,"To any person kindly given. And to the very poor
most of all."
Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Scrooge,Why to the very poor most?
Act 2,Scene 2,dialogue,Present,"Because the very poor need it most. Touch my
heart . . . here, Mr. Scrooge. We have another journey."
Act 2,Scene 2,description,,"[Scrooge touches the Ghost’s heart and music plays, lights change
color, lightning flashes, thunder claps. A choral group appears on
the street, singing Christmas carols.]"
Act 2,Scene 3,description,,"[Marley stands spotlit in front of a scrim on which is painted the
exterior of Cratchit‘s four-roomed house. There is a flash and a
clap and Marley is gone. The lights shift color again, the scrim
flies away, and we are in the interior of the Cratchit family home. Scrooge is there, with the spirit (Present), watching
Mrs. Cratchit set the table, with the help of Belinda Cratchit
and Peter Cratchit, a baby, pokes a fork into the mashed potatoes
on his highchair’s tray. He also chews on his shirt collar.]"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"What is this place, Spirit?"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Present,"This is the home of your employee, Mr. Scrooge.
Don’t you know it?"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Do you mean Cratchit, Spirit? Do you mean this is
Cratchit’s home?"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Present,None other.
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,These children are his?
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Present,There are more to come presently.
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,On his meager earnings! What foolishness!
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Present,"Foolishness, is it?"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Wouldn’t you say so? Fifteen shillings4 a week’s
what he gets!"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Present,"I would say that he gets the pleasure of his family,
fifteen times a week times the number of hours a day! Wait,
Mr. Scrooge. Wait, listen and watch. You might actually learn
something . . ."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,"What has ever got your precious father then?
And your brother, Tiny Tim? And Martha warn’t as late last
Christmas by half an hour!"

goose for us, Martha!"

you are!"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Martha,"We’d a great deal of work to finish up last night, and
had to clear away this morning, Mother."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,"Well, never mind so long as you are come. Sit
ye down before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord
bless ye!"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Belinda,"No, no! There’s Father coming. Hide, Martha, hide!"
Act 2,Scene 3,description,,[Martha giggles and hides herself.]
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Martha,Where? Here?
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Peter,"Hide, hide!"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Belinda,Not there! THERE!
Act 2,Scene 3,description,,"[Martha is hidden. Bob Cratchit enters, carrying Tiny Tim atop
his shoulder. He wears a threadbare and fringeless comforter
hanging down in front of him. Tiny Tim carries small crutches and
his small legs are bound in an iron frame brace.]"

disappointed."

him offstage.]"

singing in the copper."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Tiny Tim,The pudding? What flavor have we?
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Peter,Plum! Plum!
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Tiny Tim,"Oh, Mother! I love plum!"
Act 2,Scene 3,description,,[The children exit the stage giggling.]
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,And how did little Tim behave?
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Bob,"As good as gold, and even better. Somehow he gets
thoughtful sitting by himself so much, and thinks the
strangest things you ever heard. He told me, coming home,
that he hoped people saw him in the church, because he was
a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon
Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk and blind men
see. [Pauses] He has the oddest ideas sometimes, but he
seems all the while to be growing stronger and more
hearty . . . one would never know. [Hears Tim’s crutch on floor
outside door]"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Peter,The goose has arrived to be eaten!
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Belinda,"Oh, mama, mama, it’s beautiful."

. . . [Yells] Hurrah! Hurrah!"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Other Children,[Copying Tim] Hurrah! Hurrah!
Act 2,Scene 3,description,,"[The family sits round the table. Bob and Mrs. Cratchit serve the
trimmings, quickly. All sit; all bow heads; all pray.]"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Bob,"Thank you, dear Lord, for your many gifts . . . our dear
children; our wonderful meal; our love for one another; and
the warmth of our small fire—[Looks up at all] A merry
Christmas to us, my dear. God bless us!"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,All,[Except Tim] Merry Christmas! God bless us!
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Tiny Tim,[In a short silence] God bless us every one.
Act 2,Scene 3,description,,[All freeze. Spotlight on Present and Scrooge]
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Present,"I see a vacant seat . . . in the poor chimney corner,
and a crutch without an owner, carefully preserved. If these
shadows remain unaltered by the future, the child will die."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"No, no, kind Spirit! Say he will be spared!"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Present,"If these shadows remain unaltered by the future,
none other of my race will find him here. What then? If he be
like to die, he had better do it, and decrease the surplus
population."
Act 2,Scene 3,description,,"[Scrooge bows his head. We hear Bob‘s voice speak Scrooge’s
name.]"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Bob,Mr. Scrooge . . .
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,Huh? What’s that? Who calls?
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Bob,"[His glass raised in a toast] I’ll give you Mr. Scrooge, the
Founder of the Feast!"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Me, Bob? You toast me?"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Present,"Save your breath, Mr. Scrooge. You can’t be seen or
heard."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,"The Founder of the Feast, indeed! I wish I had
him here, that miser Scrooge. I’d give him a piece of my mind
to feast upon, and I hope he’d have a good appetite for it!"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Bob,My dear! Christmas Day!
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,"It should be Christmas Day, I am sure, on
which one drinks the health of such an odious, stingy,
unfeeling man as Mr. Scrooge . . ."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Oh. Spirit, must I? . . ."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,"You know he is, Robert! Nobody knows it
better than you do, poor fellow!"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Bob,"This is Christmas Day, and I should like to drink to
the health of the man who employs me and allows me to
earn my living and our support and that man is Ebenezer
Scrooge . . ."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,"I’ll drink to his health for your sake and the
day’s, but not for his sake . . . a Merry Christmas and a
Happy New Year to you, Mr. Scrooge, wherever you may be
this day!"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Just here, kind madam . . . out of sight, out
of sight . . ."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Bob,"Thank you, my dear. Thank you."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"Thank you, Bob . . . and Mrs. Cratchit, too. No
one else is toasting me, . . . not now . . . not ever. Of that
I am sure . . ."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Bob,Children . . .
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,All,Merry Christmas to Mr. Scrooge.
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Bob,"I’ll pay you sixpence, Tim, for my favorite song."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Tiny Tim,"Oh, Father, I’d so love to sing it, but not for pay.
This Christmas goose—this feast—you and Mother, my
brother and sisters close with me: that’s my pay—"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Bob,"Martha, will you play the notes on the lute, for Tiny
Tim’s song."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Belinda,"May I sing, too, Father?"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Bob,We’ll all sing.
Act 2,Scene 3,description,,"[They sing a song about a tiny child lost in the snow—probably
from Wordsworth’s poem. Tim sings the lead vocal; all chime in for
the chorus. Their song fades under, as the Ghost of Christmas
Present speaks.]"
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Present,"Mark my words, Ebenezer Scrooge. I do not present
the Cratchits to you because they are a handsome, or brilliant
family. They are not handsome. They are not brilliant. They
are not well-dressed, or tasteful to the times. Their shoes are
not even waterproofed by virtue of money or cleverness
spent. So when the pavement is wet, so are the insides of
their shoes and the tops of their toes. These are the Cratchits,
Mr. Scrooge. They are not highly special. They are happy,
grateful, pleased with one another, contented with the time
and how it passes. They don’t sing very well, do they? But,
nonetheless, they do sing . . . [Pauses] think of that, Scrooge.
Fifteen shillings a week and they do sing . . . hear their song
until its end."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Scrooge,"I am listening. [The chorus sings full volume now,
until . . . the song ends here.] Spirit, it must be time for us to
take our leave. I feel in my heart that it is . . . that I must think
on that which I have seen here . . ."
Act 2,Scene 3,dialogue,Present,Touch my robe again . . .
Act 2,Scene 3,description,,"[Scrooge touches Present’s robe. The lights fade out on the
Cratchits, who sit, frozen, at the table. Scrooge and Present in a
spotlight now. Thunder, lightning, smoke. They are gone.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Marley appears D.L. in single spotlight. A storm brews. Thunder
and lightning. Scrooge and Present “fly” past, U. The storm
continues, furiously, and, now and again, Scrooge and Present
will zip past in their travels. Marley will speak straight out to the
audience.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Marley,"The Ghost of Christmas Present, my co-worker in
this attempt to turn a miser, flies about now with that very
miser, Scrooge, from street to street, and he points out partygoers on their way to Christmas parties. If one were to
judge from the numbers of people on their way to friendly
gatherings, one might think that no one was left at home to
give anyone welcome . . . but that’s not the case, is it? Every
home is expecting company and . . . [He laughs.] Scrooge is
amazed."
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Scrooge and Present zip past again. The lights fade up around
them. We are in the Nephew’s home, in the living room. Present
and Scrooge stand watching the Nephew: Fred and his wife,
fixing the fire.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,What is this place? We’ve moved from the mines!
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Present,You do not recognize them?
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,It is my nephew! . . . and the one he married . . .
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Marley waves his hand and there is a lightning flash. He
disappears.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Fred,"It strikes me as sooooo funny, to think of what he
said . . . that Christmas was a humbug, as I live! He
believed it!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Wife,"More shame for him, Fred!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Fred,"Well, he’s a comical old fellow, that’s the truth."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Wife,I have no patience with him.
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Fred,"Oh, I have! I am sorry for him; I couldn’t be angry
with him if I tried. Who suffers by his ill whims? Himself,
always . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"It’s me they talk of, isn’t it, Spirit?"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Fred,"Here, wife, consider this. Uncle Scrooge takes it into his
head to dislike us, and he won’t come and dine with us.
What’s the consequence?"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Wife,"Oh . . . you’re sweet to say what I think you’re about to
say, too, Fred . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Fred,"What’s the consequence? He don’t lose much of a
dinner by it, I can telI you that!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Wife,"Ooooooo, Fred! Indeed, I think he loses a very good
dinner . . . ask my sisters, or your bachelor friend, Topper . . .
ask any of them. They’ll tell you what old Scrooge, your
uncle, missed: a dandy meal!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Fred,"Well, that’s something of a relief, wife. Glad to hear it!
[He hugs his wife. They laugh. They kiss.] The truth is, he misses
much yet. I mean to give him the same chance every year,
whether he likes it or not, for I pity him. Nay, he is my only
uncle and I feel for the old miser . . . but, I tell you, wife: I see my dear and perfect mother’s face on his own wizened
cheeks and brow: brother and sister they were, and I cannot
erase that from each view of him I take . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Wife,"I understand what you say, Fred, and I am with you in
your yearly asking. But he never will accept, you know. He
never will."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Fred,"Well, true, wife. Uncle may rail at Christmas till he dies.
I think I shook him some with my visit yesterday . . .
[Laughing] I refused to grow angry . . . no matter how nasty
he became . . . [Whoops] It was HE who grew angry, wife!
[They both laugh now.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"What he says is true, Spirit . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Fred and Wife,"Bah, humbug!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Fred,"[Embracing his wife] There is much laughter in our
marriage, wife. It pleases me. You please me . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Wife,"And you please me, Fred. You are a good man . . .
[They embrace.] Come now. We must have a look at the
meal . . . our guests will soon arrive . . . my sisters, Topper . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Fred,"A toast first . . . [He hands her a glass] A toast to Uncle
Scrooge . . . [Fills their glasses]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Wife,A toast to him?
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Fred,"Uncle Scrooge has given us plenty of merriment, I am
sure, and it would be ungrateful not to drink to his health.
And I say . . . Uncle Scrooge!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Wife,"[Laughing] You’re a proper loon,5 Fred . . . and I’m a
proper wife to you . . . [She raises her glass.] Uncle Scrooge!
[They drink. They embrace. They kiss.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Spirit, please, make me visible! Make me audible!
I want to talk with my nephew and my niece!"
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Calls out to them. The lights that light the room and Fred and wife
fade out. Scrooge and Present are alone, spotlit.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Present,"These shadows are gone to you now, Mr. Scrooge.
You may return to them later tonight in your dreams.
[Pauses] My time grows short, Ebenezer Scrooge. Look you
on me! Do you see how I’ve aged?"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Your hair has gone gray! Your skin, wrinkled! Are
spirits’ lives so short?"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Present,"My stay upon this globe is very brief. It ends
tonight."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,Tonight?
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Present,At midnight. The time is drawing near!
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,[Clock strikes 11:45.]
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Present,"Hear those chimes? In a quarter hour, my life will have been
spent! Look, Scrooge, man. Look you here."
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,[Two gnarled baby dolls are taken from Present‘s skirts.]
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,Who are they?
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Present,"They are Man’s children, and they cling to me,
appealing from their fathers. The boy is Ignorance; the girl is
Want. Beware them both, and all of their degree, but most of
all beware this boy, for I see that written on his brow which is
doom, unless the writing be erased."
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[He stretches out his arm. His voice is now amplified: loudly and
oddly.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,Have they no refuge or resource?
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Present,"Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?
[Twelve chimes] Are there no prisons? Are there no
workhouses?"
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[A Phantom, hooded, appears in dim light, D., opposite.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Present,Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,[Present begins to deliquesce. Scrooge calls after him.]
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Spirit, I’m frightened! Don’t leave me! Spirit!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Present,Prisons? Workhouses? Prisons? Workhouses . . .
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[He is gone. Scrooge is alone now with the Phantom, who is, of
course, the Ghost of Christmas Future. The Phantom is
shrouded in black. Only its outstretched hand is visible from under
his ghostly garment.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Who are you, Phantom? Oh, yes. I think I know
you! You are, are you not, the Spirit of Christmas Yet to
Come? [No reply] And you are about to show me the shadows
of the things that have not yet happened, but will happen in
time before us. Is that not so, Spirit? [The Phantom allows
Scrooge a look at his face. No other reply wanted here. A nervous
giggle here.] Oh, Ghost of the Future, I fear you more than any
Specter I have seen! But, as I know that your purpose is to do
me good and as I hope to live to be another man from what I
was, I am prepared to bear you company. [Future does not
reply, but for a stiff arm, hand and finger set, pointing forward.]
Lead on, then, lead on. The night is waning fast, and it is
precious time to me. Lead on, Spirit!"
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Future moves away from Scrooge in the same rhythm and motion
employed at its arrival. Scrooge falls into the same pattern, a
considerable space apart from the Spirit. In the space between them,
Marley appears. He looks to Future and then to Scrooge. He claps
his hands. Thunder and lightning. Three Businessmen appear,
spotlighted singularly: One is D.L.; one is D.R.; one is U.C. Thus,
six points of the stage should now be spotted in light. Marley will
watch this scene from his position, C. Scrooge and Future are R.
and L. of C.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Businessman,"Oh, no, I don’t know much about it either
way, I only know he’s dead."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Second Businessman,When did he die?
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Businessman,"Last night, I believe."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Second Businessman,"Why, what was the matter with him?
I thought he’d never die, really . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Businessman,"[Yawning] Goodness knows, goodness
knows . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Third Businessman,What has he done with his money?
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Second Businessman,I haven’t heard. Have you?
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Businessman,"Left it to his Company, perhaps. Money
to money; you know the expression . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Third Businessman,"He hasn’t left it to me. That’s all I
know . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Businessman,"[Laughing] Nor to me . . . [Looks at Second
Businessman] You, then? You got his money???"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Businessman,"[Laughing] Me, me, his money? Nooooo!"
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,[They all laugh.]
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Third Businessman,"It’s likely to be a cheap funeral, for upon
my life, I don’t know of a living soul who’d care to venture to
it. Suppose we make up a party and volunteer?"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Second Businessman,"I don’t mind going if a lunch is
provided, but I must be fed, if I make one."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Businessman,"Well, I am the most disinterested among
you, for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch. But
I’ll offer to go, if anybody else will. When I come to think of
it, I’m not all sure that I wasn’t his most particular friend: for
we used to stop and speak whenever we met. Well, then . . .
bye, bye!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Second Businessman,"Bye, bye . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Third Businessman,"Bye, bye . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[They glide offstage in three separate directions. Their lights
follow them.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Spirit, why did you show me this? Why do you
show me businessmen from my streets as they take the death
of Jacob Marley? That is a thing past. You are future!"
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Jacob Marley laughs a long, deep laugh. There is a thunder clap
and lightning flash, and he is gone. Scrooge faces Future, alone on
stage now. Future wordlessly stretches out his arm-hand-andfingerset,
pointing into the distance, U. There, above them,
scoundrels “fly” by, half-dressed and slovenly. When this scene has
passed, a woman enters the playing area. She is almost at once
followed by a second woman; and then a man in faded black; and
then, suddenly, an old man, who smokes a pipe. The old man scares
the other three. They laugh, anxious.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"Look here, old Joe, here’s a chance! If we
haven’t all three met here without meaning it!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Old Joe,"You couldn’t have met in a better place. Come into
the parlor. You were made free of it long ago, you know;
and the other two ain’t strangers [He stands; shuts a door.
Shrieking] We’re all suitable to our calling. We’re well
matched. Come into the parlor. Come into the parlor . . . [They
follow him D. Scrooge and Future are now in their midst,
watching; silent. A truck comes in on which is set a small wall with fireplace and a screen of rags, etc. All props for the scene.] Let me
just rake this fire over a bit . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[He does. He trims his lamp with the stem of his pipe. The First
Woman throws a large bundle on to the floor. She sits beside it,
crosslegged, defiantly.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"What odds then? What odds, Mrs. Dilber?
Every person has a right to take care of themselves. HE
always did!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Mrs. Dilber,That’s true indeed! No man more so!
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"Why, then, don’t stand staring as if you was
afraid, woman! Who’s the wiser? We’re not going to pick
holes in each other’s coats, I suppose?"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Mrs. Dilber,"No, indeed! We should hope not!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"Very well, then! That’s enough. Who’s the
worse for the loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man,
I suppose?"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Mrs. Dilber,"[Laughing] No, indeed!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"If he wanted to keep ’em after he was dead,
the wicked old screw, why wasn’t he natural in his lifetime?
If he had been, he’d have had somebody to look after him
when he was struck with Death, instead of lying gasping out
his last there, alone by himself."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Mrs. Dilber,"It’s the truest word that was ever spoke. It’s a
judgment on him."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"I wish it were a heavier one, and it should
have been, you may depend on it, if I could have laid my
hands on anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me
know the value of it. Speak out plain. I’m not afraid to be the
first, nor afraid for them to see it. We knew pretty well that
we were helping ourselves, before we met here, I believe. It’s
no sin. Open the bundle, Joe."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Man,"No, no, my dear! I won’t think of letting you being
the first to show what you’ve . . . earned . . . earned from this.
I throw in mine."
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[He takes a bundle from his shoulder, turns it upside down, and
empties its contents out on to the floor.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Man,"It’s not very extensive, see . . . seals . . . a pencil case . . . sleeve
buttons . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"Nice sleeve buttons, though . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Man,"Not bad, not bad . . . a brooch there . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Old Joe,"Not really valuable, I’m afraid . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Man,"How much, old Joe?"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Old Joe,"[Writing on the wall with chalk] A pitiful lot, really.
Ten and six and not a sixpence more!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Man,You’re not serious!
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Old Joe,"That’s your account and I wouldn’t give another
sixpence if I was to be boiled for not doing it. Who’s next?"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Mrs. Dilber,"Me! [Dumps out contents of her bundle] Sheets,
towels, silver spoons, silver sugar-tongs . . . some boots . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Old Joe,"[Writing on wall] I always give too much to the
ladies. It’s a weakness of mine and that’s the way I ruin
myself. Here’s your total comin’ up . . . two pounds-ten . . . if
you asked me for another penny, and made it an open
question, I’d repent of being so liberal and knock off
half-a-crown."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"And now do MY bundle, Joe."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Old Joe,"[Kneeling to open knots on her bundle] So many
knots, madam . . . [He drags out large curtains; dark] What do
you call this? Bed curtains!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"[Laughing] Ah, yes, bed curtains!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Old Joe,"You don’t mean to say you took ’em down, rings
and all, with him lying there?"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"Yes, I did, why not?"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Old Joe,"You were born to make your fortune and you’ll
certainly do it."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"I certainly shan’t hold my hand, when I can
get anything in it by reaching it out, for the sake of such a
man as he was. I promise you, Joe. Don’t drop that lamp oil
on those blankets, now!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Old Joe,His blankets?
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"Whose else’s do you think? He isn’t likely to
catch cold without ’em, I daresay."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Old Joe,I hope that he didn’t die of anything catching? Eh?
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"Don’t you be afraid of that. I ain’t so fond of
his company that I’d loiter about him for such things if he
did. Ah! You may look through that shirt till your eyes ache,
but you won’t find a hole in it, nor a threadbare place. It’s the
best he had, and a fine one, too. They’d have wasted it, if it
hadn’t been for me."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Old Joe,What do you mean “They’d have wasted it”?
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"Putting it on him to be buried in, to be sure.
Somebody was fool enough to do it, but I took it off again . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[She laughs, as do they all, nervously.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,First Woman,"If calico ain’t good enough for such a purpose, it isn’t good
enough then for anything. It’s quite as becoming to the body.
He can’t look uglier than he did in that one!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"[A low-pitched moan emits from his mouth; from the
bones.] OOOOOOOoooooOOOOOoooooOOOOOOOO
oooooOOOOOOoooooOO!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Old Joe,"One pound six for the lot. [He produces a small
flannel bag filled with money. He divvies it out. He continues
to pass around the money as he speaks. All are laughing.]
That’s the end of it, you see! He frightened every one away
from him when he was alive, to profit us when he was dead!
Hah ha ha!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,All,HAHAHAHAhahahahahahah!
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"OOoooOOoooOOOoooOOOoooOOoooOOoooOOOooo!
[He screams at them.] Obscene demons! Why not market the
corpse itself, as sell its trimming??? [Suddenly] Oh, Spirit, I see
it, I see it! This unhappy man—this stripped-bare corpse . . .
could very well be my own. My life holds parallel! My life
ends that way now!"
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Scrooge backs into something in the dark behind his spotlight.
Scrooge looks at Future, who points to the corpse. Scrooge pulls
back the blanket. The corpse is, of course, Scrooge, who screams.
He falls aside the bed; weeping.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Spirit, this is a fearful place. In leaving it, I shall not leave its
lesson, trust me. Let us go!"
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,[Future points to the corpse.]
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Spirit, let me see some tenderness connected with a death, or
that dark chamber, which we just left now, Spirit, will be
forever present to me."
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Future spreads his robes again. Thunder and lightning. Lights up,
U., in the Cratchit home setting. Mrs. Cratchit and her daughters,
sewing]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Tiny Tim's Voice,"[Off] And He took a child and set him in
the midst of them."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"[Looking about the room; to Future] Huh? Who
spoke? Who said that?"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,"[Puts down her sewing] The color hurts my
eyes. [Rubs her eyes] That’s better. My eyes grow weak
sewing by candlelight. I shouldn’t want to show your father
weak eyes when he comes home . . . not for the world! It
must be near his time . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Peter,"[In corner, reading. Looks up from book] Past it, rather.
But l think he’s been walking a bit slower than usual these
last few evenings, Mother."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,"I have known him walk with . . . [Pauses] I
have known him walk with Tiny Tim upon his shoulder and
very fast indeed."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Peter,"So have I, Mother! Often!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Daughter,So have I.
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,"But he was very light to carry and his father
loved him so, that it was not trouble—no trouble. [Bob, at door]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,And there is your father at the door.
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Bob Cratchit enters. He wears a comforter. He is cold, forlorn.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Peter,Father!
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Bob,"Hello, wife, children . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,[The daughter weeps; turns away from Cratchit.]
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Bob,"Children! How good to see you all! And you, wife. And look
at this sewing! I’ve no doubt, with all your industry, we’ll
have a quilt to set down upon our knees in church on
Sunday!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,"You made the arrangements today, then,
Robert, for the . . . service . . . to be on Sunday."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Bob,"The funeral. Oh, well, yes, yes, I did. I wish you could
have gone. It would have done you good to see how green a
place it is. But you’ll see it often. I promised him that I would
walk there on Sunday, after the service. [Suddenly]
My little, little child! My little child!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,All Children,"[Hugging him] Oh, Father . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Bob,"[He stands] Forgive me. I saw Mr. Scrooge’s nephew,
who you know I’d just met once before, and he was so
wonderful to me, wife . . . he is the most pleasant-spoken
gentleman I’ve ever met . . . he said “I am heartily sorry for
it and heartily sorry for your good wife. If I can be of service
to you in any way, here’s where I live.” And he gave me
this card."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Peter,Let me see it!
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Bob,"And he looked me straight in the eye, wife, and said,
meaningfully, “I pray you’ll come to me, Mr. Cratchit, if you
need some help. I pray you do.” Now it wasn’t for the sake of
anything that he might be able to do for us, so much as for
his kind way. It seemed as if he had known our Tiny Tim and
felt with us."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,I’m sure that he’s a good soul.
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Bob,"You would be surer of it, my dear, if you saw and spoke
to him. I shouldn’t be at all surprised, if he got Peter a
situation."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Mrs. Cratchit,"Only hear that, Peter!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Martha,"And then, Peter will be keeping company with
someone and setting up for himself!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Peter,Get along with you!
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Bob,"It’s just as likely as not, one of these days, though
there’s plenty of time for that, my dear. But however and
whenever we part from one another, I am sure we shall none
of us forget poor Tiny Tim—shall we?—or this first parting
that was among us?"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,All Children,"Never, Father, never!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Bob,"And when we recollect how patient and mild he was,
we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves, and forget poor
Tiny Tim in doing it."
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,All Children,"No, Father, never!"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Little Bob,"I am very happy, I am. I am. I am very happy."
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Bob kisses his little son, as does Mrs. Cratchit, as do the other
children. The family is set now in one sculptural embrace. The
lighting fades to a gentle pool of light, tight on them.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Specter, something informs me that our parting
moment is at hand. I know it, but I know not how I know it."
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Future points to the other side of the stage. Lights out on
Cratchits. Future moves slowing, gliding. Scrooge follows.
Future points opposite. Future leads Scrooge to a wall and a
tombstone. He points to the stone.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Am I that man those ghoulish parasites7 so gloated over?
[Pauses] Before I draw nearer to that stone to which you
point, answer me one question. Are these the shadows
of things that will be, or the shadows of things that MAY
be, only?"
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Future points to the gravestone. Marley appears in light well U.
He points to grave as well. Gravestone turns front and grows to ten
feet high. Words upon it: Ebenezer Scrooge: Much smoke billows
now from the grave. Choral music here. Scrooge stands looking up
at gravestone. Future does not at all reply in mortals’ words, but
points once more to the gravestone. The stone undulates and glows.
Music plays, beckoning Scrooge. Scrooge reeling in terror]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Oh, no. Spirit! Oh, no, no!"
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,[Future’s finger still pointing]
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Spirit! Hear me! I am not the man I was. I will not be the man
I would have been but for this intercourse. Why show me
this, if I am past all hope?"
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,[Future considers Scrooge’s logic. His hand wavers.]
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Oh. Good Spirit, I see by your wavering hand that your good
nature intercedes for me and pities me. Assure me that I yet
may change these shadows that you have shown me by an
altered life!"
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,[Future’s hand trembles; pointing has stopped.]
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"I will honor Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the
year. I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The
Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out
the lessons that they teach. Oh, tell me that I may sponge
away the writing that is upon this stone!"
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Scrooge makes a desperate stab at grabbing Future’s hand. He
holds firm for a moment, but Future, stronger than Scrooge, pulls
away. Scrooge is on his knees, praying.]"
Act 2,Scene 4,dialogue,Scrooge,"Spirit, dear Spirit, I am praying before you. Give me a
sign that all is possible. Give me a sign that all hope for me
is not lost. Oh, Spirit, kind Spirit, I beseech thee: give me
a sign . . ."
Act 2,Scene 4,description,,"[Future deliquesces, slowly, gently. The Phantom’s hood and robe
drop gracefully to the ground in a small heap. Music in. There is
nothing in them. They are mortal cloth. The Spirit is elsewhere.
Scrooge has his sign. Scrooge is alone. Tableau. The light fades
to black.]"
Act 2,Scene 5,description,,"[The end of it. Marley, spotlighted, opposite Scrooge, in his bed,
spotlighted. Marley speaks to audience, directly.]"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Marley,"[He smiles at Scrooge.] The firm of Scrooge and
Marley is doubly blessed; two misers turned; one, alas, in
Death, too late; but the other miser turned in Time’s
penultimate nick.8 Look you on my friend, Ebenezer
Scrooge . . ."
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"[Scrambling out of bed; reeling in delight] I will live in
the Past, in the Present, and in the Future! The Spirits of all
Three shall strive within me!"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Marley,"[He points and moves closer to Scrooge‘s bed.] Yes,
Ebenezer, the bedpost is your own. Believe it! Yes, Ebenezer,
the room is your own. Believe it!"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Oh, Jacob Marley! Wherever you are, Jacob, know
ye that I praise you for this! I praise you . . . and heaven . . .
and Christmastime! [Kneels facing away from Marley] I say it
to you on my knees, old Jacob, on my knees! [He touches his
bed curtains.] Not torn down. My bed curtains are not at all
torn down! Rings and all, here they are! They are here: I am
here: the shadows of things that would have been, may now
be dispelled. They will be, Jacob! I know they will be!"
Act 2,Scene 5,description,,"[He chooses clothing for the day. He tries different pieces of clothing
and settles, perhaps, on a dress suit, plus a cape of the bed clothing:
something of color.]"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"I am light as a feather, I am happy as an angel. I am as merry
as a schoolboy. [Yells out window and then out to audience]
Merry Christmas to everybody! Merry Christmas to
everybody! A Happy New Year to all the world! Hallo here!
Whoop! Whoop! Hallo! Hallo! I don’t know what day of the
month it is! I don’t care! I don’t know anything! I’m quite a
baby! I don’t care! I don’t care a fig! I’d much rather be a baby than be an old wreck like me or Marley! (Sorry, Jacob.
wherever ye be!) Hallo! Hallo there!"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"[Church bells chime in Christmas Day. A small boy, named Adam,
is seen now D.R., as a light fades up on him.] Hey, you boy!
What’s today? What day of the year is it?"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Adam,"Today, sir? Why, it’s Christmas Day!"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"It’s Christmas Day, is it? Whoop! Well, I haven’t
missed it after all, have I? The Spirits did all they did in one
night. They can do anything they like, right? Of course they
can! Of course they can!"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Adam,"Excuse me, sir?"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Huh? Oh, yes, of course. What’s your name, lad?"
Act 2,Scene 5,description,,"[Scrooge and Adam will play their scene from their own
spotlights.]"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Adam,"Adam, sir."
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Adam! What a fine, strong name! Do you know the
poulterer’s in the next street but one, at the corner?"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Adam,"I certainly should hope I know him, sir!"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"A remarkable boy! An intelligent boy! Do you
know whether the poulterer’s have sold the prize turkey that
was hanging up there? I don’t mean the little prize turkey,
Adam. I mean the big one!"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Adam,"What, do you mean the one they’ve got that’s as big
as me?"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"I mean, the turkey the size of Adam: that’s the bird!"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Adam,"It’s hanging there now, sir."
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"It is? Go and buy it! No, no. I am absolutely in
earnest. Go and buy it and tell ’em to bring it here, so that I
may give them the directions to where I want it delivered, as
a gift. Come back here with the man, Adam, and I’ll give you
a shilling. Come back here with him in less than five minutes,
and I’ll give you half-a-crown!"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Adam,"Oh, my sir! Don’t let my brother in on this."
Act 2,Scene 5,description,,[Adam runs offstage. Marley smiles.]
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Marley,"An act of kindness is like the first green grape of
summer: one leads to another and another and another. It
would take a queer man indeed to not follow an act of
kindness with an act of kindness. One simply whets the
tongue for more . . . the taste of kindness is too too sweet.
Gifts—goods—are lifeless. But the gift of goodness one feels
in the giving is full of life. It . . . is . . . a . . . wonder."
Act 2,Scene 5,description,,"[Pauses; moves closer to Scrooge, who is totally occupied with his
dressing and arranging of his room and his day. He is making lists,
etc. Marley reaches out to Scrooge.]"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Adam,"[Calling, off] I’m here! I’m here!"
Act 2,Scene 5,description,,"[Adam runs on with a man, who carries an enormous turkey.]"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Adam,"Here I am, sir. Three minutes flat! A world record! I’ve got the
poultryman and he’s got the poultry! [He pants, out of breath.]
I have earned my prize, sir, if I live . . ."
Act 2,Scene 5,description,,"[He holds his heart, playacting. Scrooge goes to him and embraces
him.]"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"You are truly a champion, Adam . . ."
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,"Here’s the bird you ordered, sir . . ."
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Oh, my, MY!!! Look at the size of that turkey, will
you! He never could have stood upon his legs, that bird! He
would have snapped them off in a minute, like sticks of sealingwax! Why you’ll never be able to carry that bird to Camden-Town, I’ll give you money for a cab . . ."
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,"Camden-Town’s where it’s goin’, sir?"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Oh, I didn’t tell you? Yes, I’ve written the precise
address down just here on this . . . [Hands paper to him] Bob
Cratchit’s house. Now he’s not to know who sends him this.
Do you understand me? Not a word . . . [Handing out money
and chuckling]"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,"I understand, sir, not a word."
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Good. There you go then . . . this is for the
turkey . . . [Chuckle] . . . and this is for the taxi. [Chuckle] . . .
and this is for your world-record run, Adam . . ."
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Adam,"But I don’t have change for that, sir."
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Then keep it, my lad. It’s Christmas!"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Adam,"[He kisses Scrooge’s cheek, quickly.] Thank you, sir.
Merry, Merry Christmas! [He runs off.]"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,"And you’ve given me a bit overmuch here, too, sir . . ."
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Of course I have, sir. It’s Christmas!"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Man,"Oh, well, thanking you, sir. I’ll have this bird to
Mr. Cratchit and his family in no time, sir. Don’t you worry
none about that. Merry Christmas to you, sir, and a very
happy New Year, too . . ."
Act 2,Scene 5,description,,"[The man exits. Scrooge walks in a large circle about the stage,
which is now gently lit. A chorus sings Christmas music far in the
distance. Bells chime as well, far in the distance. A gentlewoman
enters and passes. Scrooge is on the streets now.]"

Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"Yes, Scrooge is my name though I’m afraid you
may not find it very pleasant. Allow me to ask your pardon.
And will you have the goodness to—[He whispers into the
man’s ear.]"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Portly Man,"Lord bless me! My dear Mr. Scrooge, are you
serious!?!"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"If you please. Not a farthing10 less. A great many
back payments are included in it, I assure you. Will you do
me that favor?"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Portly Man,"My dear sir, I don’t know what to say to such
munifi—"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"[Cutting him off] Don’t say anything, please. Come
and see me. Will you?"

pleasure!"

fifty times. Bless you!"
Act 2,Scene 5,description,,"[Portly Man passes offstage, perhaps by moving backwards.
Scrooge now comes to the room of his Nephew and Niece. He
stops at the door, begins to knock on it, loses his courage, tries
again, loses his courage again, tries again, fails again, and then
backs off and runs at the door, causing a tremendous bump against
it. The Nephew and Niece are startled. Scrooge, poking head
into room]"

other room.]"

Scrooge! He’s come for our Christmas party!"
Act 2,Scene 5,description,,"[Music in. Lighting here indicates that day has gone to night and
gone to day again. It is early, early morning. Scrooge walks alone
from the party, exhausted, to his offices, opposite side of the stage.
He opens his offices. The offices are as they were at the start of the
play. Scrooge seats himself with his door wide open so he can see
into the tank, as he awaits Cratchit, who enters, head down, full of
guilt. Cratchit, starts writing almost before he sits.]"
Act 2,Scene 5,dialogue,Scrooge,"What do you mean by coming in here at this time
