THE PLACE OF THE PLAY Various locations in
and around the City of London, including Scrooge’s
Chambers and Offices; the Cratchit Home; Fred’s
Home; Scrooge’s School; Fezziwig’s Offices; Old Joe’s
Hide-a-Way.
THE TIME OF THE PLAY The entire action of the
play takes place on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and
the morning after Christmas, 1843.

Scene 1

[Ghostly music in auditorium. A single spotlight on Jacob Marley,
D.C. He is ancient; awful, dead-eyed. He speaks straight out to
auditorium.]

Marley. [Cackle-voiced] My name is Jacob Marley and I am
dead. [He laughs.] Oh, no, there’s no doubt that I am dead.
The register of my burial was signed by the clergyman, the
clerk, the undertaker . . . and by my chief mourner . . .
Ebenezer Scrooge . . . [Pause; remembers] I am dead as a
doornail.

[A spotlight fades up, Stage Right, on Scrooge, in his counting-
house counting. Lettering on the window behind Scrooge reads:
“Scrooge and Marley, Ltd.” The spotlight is tight on Scrooge’s
head and shoulders. We shall not yet see into the offices and setting.
Ghostly music continues, under. Marley looks across at Scrooge;
pitifully. After a moment’s pause]

I present him to you: Ebenezer Scrooge . . . England’s most
tightfisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a squeezing,
wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old
sinner! secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.
The cold within him freezes his old features, nips his pointed
nose, shrivels his cheek, stiffens his gait; makes his eyes red,
his thin lips blue; and speaks out shrewdly in his grating
voice. Look at him. Look at him . . .

[Scrooge counts and mumbles.]

Scrooge. They owe me money and I will collect. I will have
them jailed, if I have to. They owe me money and I will
collect what is due me.

[Marley moves towards Scrooge; two steps. The spotlight stays
with him.]


Marley. [Disgusted] He and I were partners for I don’t know
how many years. Scrooge was my sole executor, my sole
administrator, my sole assign, my sole residuary legatee,
my sole friend and my sole mourner. But Scrooge was not so cut
up by the sad event of my death, but that he was an excellent
man of business on the very day of my funeral, and
solemnized it with an undoubted bargain. [Pauses again in
disgust] He never painted out my name from the window.
There it stands, on the window and above the warehouse
door: Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to our
business call him Scrooge and sometimes they call him
Marley. He answers to both names. It’s all the same to him.
And it’s cheaper than painting in a new sign, isn’t it? [Pauses;
moves closer to Scrooge] Nobody has ever stopped him in the
street to say, with gladsome looks, “My dear Scrooge, how
are you? When will you come to see me?” No beggars
implored him to bestow a trifle, no children ever ask him
what it is o’clock, no man or woman now, or ever in his life,
not once, inquire the way to such and such a place. [Marley
stands next to Scrooge now. They share, so it seems, a spotlight.]
But what does Scrooge care of any of this? It is the very thing
he likes! To edge his way along the crowded paths of life,
warning all human sympathy to keep its distance.

[A ghostly bell rings in the distance. Marley moves away from
Scrooge, now, heading D. again. As he does, he “takes” the light:
Scrooge has disappeared into the black void beyond. Marley walks
D.C., talking directly to the audience. Pauses]

The bell tolls and l must take my leave. You must stay a while
with Scrooge and watch him play out his scroogey life. It is
now the story: the once-upon-a-time. Scrooge is busy in his
counting-house. Where else? Christmas eve and Scrooge is
busy in his counting-house. It is cold, bleak, biting weather
outside: foggy withal: and, if you listen closely, you can
hear the people in the court go wheezing up and down,
beating their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their
feet upon the pavement stones to warm them . . .

[The clocks outside strike three.]

Only three! and quite dark outside already: it has not been
light all day this day.

[This ghostly bell rings in the distance again. Marley looks about
him. Music in. Marley flies away.]

[N.B. Marley’s comings and goings should, from time to time,
induce the explosion of the odd flash-pot, I.H.]


Scene 2

[Christmas music in, sung by a live chorus, full. At conclusion of
song, sound fades under and into the distance. Lights up in set:
offices of Scrooge and Marley, Ltd. Scrooge sits at his desk, at
work. Near him is a tiny fire. His door is open and in his line of
vision, we see Scrooge’s clerk, Bob Cratchit, who sits in a dismal
tank of a cubicle, copying letters. Near Cratchit is a fire so tiny as
to barely cast a light: perhaps it is one pitifully glowing coal?
Cratchit rubs his hands together, puts on a white comforter4
andtries to heat his hands around his candle. Scrooge’s Nephew
enters, unseen.]

Scrooge. What are you doing, Cratchit? Acting cold, are
you? Next, you’ll be asking to replenish your coal from my
coal-box, won’t you? Well, save your breath, Cratchit! Unless
you’re prepared to find employ elsewhere!

Nephew. [Cheerfully; surprising Scrooge] A merry Christmas
to you, Uncle! God save you!

Scrooge. Bah! Humbug!
Nephew. Christmas a “humbug,” Uncle? I’m sure you don’t
mean that.

Scrooge. I do! Merry Christmas? What right do you have to
be merry? What reason have you to be merry? You’re poor
enough!

Nephew. Come, then. What right have you to be dismal?
What reason have you to be morose? You’re rich enough.
Scrooge. Bah! Humbug!

Nephew. Don’t be cross, Uncle.

Scrooge. What else can I be? Eh? When I live in a world of
fools such as this? Merry Christmas? What’s Christmastime
to you but a time of paying bills without any money; a time
for finding yourself a year older, but not an hour richer. If I
could work my will, every idiot who goes about with “Merry
Christmas” on his lips, should be boiled with his own
pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through his heart.
He should!

Nephew. Uncle!

Scrooge. Nephew! You keep Christmas in your own way
and let me keep it in mine.
Nephew. Keep it! But you don’t keep it, Uncle.
Scrooge. Let me leave it alone, then. Much good it has ever
done you!

Nephew. There are many things from which I have derived
good, by which I have not profited, I daresay. Christmas
among the rest. But l am sure that l always thought of
Christmas time, when it has come round—as a good time: the
only time I know of, when men and women seem to open
their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them
as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not
another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And
therefore, Uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or
silver in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and
that it will do me good; and I say, God bless it!
[The Clerk in the tank applauds, looks at the furious Scrooge and
pokes out his tiny fire, as if in exchange for the moment of
impropriety. Scrooge yells at him.]

Scrooge. [To the clerk] Let me hear another sound from you
and you’ll keep your Christmas by losing your situation. [To
the nephew] You’re quite a powerful speaker, sir. I wonder you
don’t go into Parliament.

Nephew. Don’t be angry, Uncle. Come! Dine with us
tomorrow.

Scrooge. I’d rather see myself dead than see myself with
your family!

Nephew. But, why? Why?

Scrooge. Why did you get married?

Nephew. Because I fell in love.

Scrooge. That, sir, is the only thing that you have said to me
in your entire lifetime which is even more ridiculous than
“Merry Christmas!” [Turns from Nephew] Good afternoon.

Nephew. Nay, Uncle, you never came to see me before I
married either. Why give it as a reason for not coming now?

Scrooge. Good afternoon, Nephew!

Nephew. I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why
cannot we be friends?

Scrooge. Good afternoon!

Nephew. I am sorry with all my heart, to find you so
resolute. But I have made the trial in homage to Christmas,
and I’ll keep my Christmas humor to the last. So A Merry
Christmas, Uncle!

Scrooge. Good afternoon!

Nephew. And a Happy New Year!

Nephew. [He stands facing Scrooge.] Uncle, you are the
most . . . [Pauses] No, I shan’t. My Christmas humor is
intact . . . [Pause] God bless you, Uncle . . . [Nephew turns and
starts for the door; he stops at Cratchit‘s cage.] Merry Christmas,
Bob Cratchit . . .

Cratchit. Merry Christmas to you sir, and a very, very happy
New Year . . .

Scrooge. [Calling across to them] Oh, fine, a perfection, just
fine . . . to see the perfect pair of you; husbands, with wives
and children to support . . . my clerk there earning fifteen
shillings a week . . . and the perfect pair of you, talking about
a Merry Christmas! [Pauses] I’ll retire to Bedlam!

Nephew. [To Cratchit] He’s impossible!

Cratchit. Oh, mind him not, sir. He’s getting on in years, and
he’s alone. He’s noticed your visit. I’ll wager your visit has
warmed him.

Nephew. Him? Uncle Ebenezer Scrooge? Warmed? You are a
better Christian than I am, sir.

Cratchit. [Opening the door for Nephew; two Do-Gooders
will enter, as Nephew exits] Good day to you, sir, and
God bless.

Nephew. God bless . . . [One man who enters is portly, the other
is thin. Both are pleasant.]

Cratchit. Can I help you, gentlemen?

Thin Man. [Carrying papers and books; looks around Cratchit to
Scrooge] Scrooge and Marley’s, I believe. Have I the pleasure
of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr. Marley?

Scrooge. Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years. He
died seven years ago this very night.

Portly Man. We have no doubt his liberality
is well represented by his surviving partner . . . [Offers his
calling card]

Scrooge. [Handing back the card; unlooked at] . . . Good
afternoon.

Thin Man. This will take but a moment, sir . . .

Portly Man. At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge, it
is more than usually desirable that we should make some
slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly
at the present time. Many thousands are in want of common
necessities; hundreds of thousands are in want of common
comforts, sir.

Scrooge. Are there no prisons?

Portly Man. Plenty of prisons.

Scrooge. And aren’t the Union workhouses still in
operation?

Thin Man. They are. Still, I wish that I could say that they
are not.

Scrooge. The Treadmil and the Poor Law are in full vigor, then?

Thin Man. Both very busy, sir.

Scrooge. Ohhh, I see. I was afraid, from what you said at
first, that something had occurred to stop them from their
useful course. [Pauses] I’m glad to hear it.

Portly Man. Under the impression that they scarcely furnish
Christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude, a few of us
are endeavoring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat
and drink, and means of warmth. We choose this time,
because it is a time, of all others, when Want is keenly felt,
and Abundance rejoices. [Pen in hand; as well as notepad] What
shall I put you down for, sir?

Scrooge. Nothing!

Portly Man. You wish to be left anonymous?

Scrooge. I wish to be left alone! [Pauses; turns away; turns
back to them] Since you ask me what I wish, gentlemen, that is
my answer. I help to support the establishments that I have
mentioned: they cost enough: and those who are badly off
must go there.

Thin Man. Many can’t go there; and many would rather die.
Scrooge. If they would rather die, they had better do it, and
decrease the surplus population. Besides—excuse me—I
don’t know that.

Thin Man. But you might know it!

Scrooge. It’s not my business. It’s enough for a man to
understand his own business, and not to interfere with other
people’s. Mine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon,
gentlemen!

[Scrooge turns his back on the gentlemen and returns to his desk.]
Portly Man. But, sir, Mr. Scrooge . . . think of the poor.

Scrooge. [Turns suddenly to them. Pauses] Take your leave of
my offices, sirs, while I am still smiling.

[The Thin Man looks at the Portly Man. They are undone. They
shrug. They move to the door. Cratchit hops up to open it for them.]

Thin Man. Good day, sir . . . [To Cratchit] A merry Christmas
to you, sir . . .

Cratchit. Yes. A Merry Christmas to both of you . . .

Portly Man. Merry Christmas . . .

[Cratchit silently squeezes something into the hand of the Thin Man.]

Thin Man. What’s this?

Cratchit. Shhhh . . .

[Cratchit opens the door; wind and snow whistle into the room.]

Thin Man. Thank you, sir, thank you.

[Cratchit closes the door and returns to his workplace. Scrooge is
at his own counting table. He talks to Cratchit without looking up.]

Scrooge. It’s less of a time of year for being merry, and more
a time of year for being loony . . . if you ask me.

Cratchit. Well, I don’t know, sir . . . [The clock’s bell strikes six
o’clock.] Well, there it is, eh, six?

Scrooge. Saved by six bells, are you?

Cratchit. I must be going home . . . [He snuffs out his candle
and puts on his hat.] I hope you have a . . . very very lovely
day tomorrow, sir . . .

Scrooge. Hmmm. Oh, you’ll be wanting the whole day
tomorrow, I suppose?

Cratchit. If quite convenient, sir.

Scrooge. It’s not convenient, and it’s not fair. If I was to stop
half-a-crown for it, you’d think yourself ill-used, I’ll be bound?

[Cratchit smiles faintly.]

Cratchit. I don’t know, sir . . .

Scrooge. And yet, you don’t think me ill-used when I pay a
day’s wages for no work . . .

Cratchit. It’s only but once a year . . .

Scrooge. A poor excuse for picking a man’s pocket every
25th of December! But l suppose you must have the whole
day. Be here all the earlier the next morning!

Cratchit. Oh, I will, sir. I will. I promise you. And, sir . . .
Scrooge. Don’t say it, Cratchit.

Cratchit. But let me wish you a . . .

Scrooge. Don’t say it, Cratchit. I warn you . . .

Cratchit. Sir!

Scrooge. Cratchit!

[Cratchit opens the door.]

Cratchit. All right, then, sir . . . well . . . [Suddenly] Merry
Christmas, Mr. Scrooge!

[And he runs out the door, shutting same behind him. Scrooge
moves to his desk; gathering his coat, hat, etc. A Boy appears at his
window . . . . ]

Boy. [Singing] “Away in a manger . . .”

[Scrooge seizes his ruler and whacks at the image of the Boy
outside. The Boy leaves.]

Scrooge. Bah! Humbug! Christmas! Bah! Humbug! [He shuts
out the light.]

A note on the crossover, following Scene 2:

[Scrooge will walk alone to his rooms from his offices. As he makes
a long slow cross of the stage, the scenery should change. Christmas
music will be heard, various people will cross by Scrooge, often
smiling happily.

There will be occasional pleasant greetings tossed at him.

Scrooge, in contrast to all, will grump and mumble. He will snap
at passing boys, as might a horrid old hound.

In short, Scrooge’s sounds and movements will define him in
contrast from all other people who cross the stage: he is the
misanthrope, the malcontent, the miser. He is Scrooge.

This statement of Scrooge’s character, by contrast to all other
characters, should seem comical to the audience.

During Scrooge’s crossover to his rooms, snow should begin to
fall. All passers-by will hold their faces to the sky, smiling,
allowing snow to shower them lightly. Scrooge, by contrast, will
bat at the flakes with his walking-stick, as might an insomniac swat
at a sleep-stopping, middle-of-the-night swarm of mosquitoes. He
will comment on the blackness of the night, and, finally, reach his
rooms and his encounter with the magical specter: Marley, his
eternal mate.]

Scene 3

Scrooge. No light at all . . . no moon . . . that is what is at the
center of Christmas Eve: dead black: void . . .

[Scrooge puts his key in the door’s keyhole. He has reached his
rooms now. The door knocker changes and is now Marley’s face.
A musical sound: quickly: ghostly. Marley‘s image is not at all
angry, but looks at Scrooge as did the old Marley look at Scrooge.
The hair is curiously stirred; eyes wide open, dead: absent of focus.
Scrooge stares wordlessly here. The face, before his very eyes, does
deliquesce. It is a knocker again. Scrooge opens the door and
checks the back of same, probably for Marley‘s pigtail. Seeing
nothing but screws and nuts, Scrooge refuses the memory.]

Pooh, pooh!

[The sound of the door closing resounds throughout the house as
thunder. Every room echoes the sound. Scrooge fastens the door
and walks across the hall to the stairs, trimming his candle as he
goes; and then he goes slowly up the staircase. He checks each room:
sitting room, bedrooms, lumber-room. He looks under the sofa,
under the table: nobody there. He fixes his evening gruel on the
hob, changes his jacket. Scrooge sits near the tiny low-flamed fire,
sipping his gruel. There are various pictures on the walls: all of
them now show likenesses of Marley. Scrooge blinks his eyes.]

Bah! Humbug!

[Scrooge walks in a circle about the room. The pictures change back
into their natural images. He sits down at the table in front of the
fire. A bell hangs overhead. It begins to ring, of its own accord.
Slowly, surely, begins the ringing of every bell in the house. They
continue ringing for nearly half a minute. Scrooge is stunned by
the phenomenon. The bells cease their ringing all at once. Deep
below Scrooge, in the basement of the house, there is the sound of
clanking, of some enormous chain being dragged across the floors;
and now up the stairs. We hear doors flying open.]

Bah still! Humbug still! This is not happening! I won’t
believe it!

[Marley’s Ghost enters the room. He is horrible to look at: pigtail,
vest, suit as usual, but he drags an enormous chain now, to which
is fastened cash-boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers, deeds, and heavy
purses fashioned of steel. He is transparent. Marley stands opposite
the stricken Scrooge.]

How now! What do you want of me?

Marley. Much!

Scrooge. Who are you?

Marley. Ask me who I was.

Scrooge Who were you then?

Marley. In life, I was your business partner: Jacob Marley.

Scrooge. I see . . . can you sit down?

Marley. I can.

Scrooge. Do it then.

Marley. I shall. [Marley sits opposite Scrooge, in the chair across
the table, at the front of the fireplace.] You don’t believe in me.
Scrooge. I don’t.

Marley. Why do you doubt your senses?

Scrooge. Because every little thing affects them. A slight
disorder of the stomach makes them cheat. You may be an
undigested bit of beef, a blot of mustard, a crumb of cheese, a
fragment of an underdone potato. There’s more of gravy than
of grave about you, whatever you are!

[There is a silence between them. Scrooge is made nervous by it.
He picks up a toothpick.]

Humbug! I tell you: humbug!

[Marley opens his mouth and screams a ghostly, fearful scream.
The scream echoes about each room of the house. Bats fly, cats
screech, lightning flashes. Scrooge stands and walks backwards
against the wall. Marley stands and screams again. This time, he
takes his head and lifts it from his shoulders. His head continues to
scream. Marley’s face again appears on every picture in the room:
all screaming. Scrooge, on his knees before Marley.]
Mercy! Dreadful apparition, mercy! Why, O! why do you
trouble me so?

Marley. Man of the worldly mind, do you believe in me,
or not?

Scrooge. I do. I must. But why do spirits such as you walk
the earth? And why do they come to me?

Marley. It is required of every man that the spirit within him
should walk abroad among his fellow-men, and travel far
and wide; and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is
condemned to do so after death. [Marley screams again; a
tragic scream; from his ghostly bones.] I wear the chain I forged
in life. I made it link by link, and yard by yard. Is its pattern
strange to you? Or would you know, you, Scrooge, the weight
and length of the strong coil you bear yourself? It was full as 
heavy and long as this, seven Christmas Eves ago. You have
labored on it, since. It is a ponderous chain.

[Terrified that a chain will appear about his body, Scrooge spins
and waves the unwanted chain away. None, of course, appears. Sees
Marley watching him dance about the room. Marley watches
Scrooge; silently.]

Scrooge. Jacob. Old Jacob Marley, tell me more. Speak
comfort to me, Jacob . . .

Marley. I have none to give. Comfort comes from other
regions, Ebenezer Scrooge, and is conveyed by other
ministers, to other kinds of men. A very little more, is all that
is permitted to me. I cannot rest, I cannot stay, I cannot linger
anywhere . . . [He moans again.] My spirit never walked
beyond our counting-house—mark me!—in life my spirit 
never roved beyond the narrow limits of our money-
changing hole; and weary journeys lie before me!

Scrooge. But you were always a good man of business,
Jacob.

Marley. [Screams word “business”; a flash-pot explodes with him.]
BUSINESS!!! Mankind was my business. The common
welfare was my business; charity, mercy, forbearance,
benevolence, were, all, my business. [Scrooge is quaking.]
Hear me, Ebenezer Scrooge! My time is nearly gone.
Scrooge. I will, but don’t be hard upon me. And don’t be
flowery, Jacob! Pray!

Marley. How is it that I appear before you in a shape that
you can see, l may not tell. I have sat invisible beside you
many and many a day. That is no light part of my penance. I
am here tonight to warn you that you have yet a chance and
hope of escaping my fate. A chance and hope of my
procuring, Ebenezer.

Scrooge. You were always a good friend to me. Thank’ee!

Marley. You will be haunted by Three Spirits.

Scrooge. Would that be the chance and hope you mentioned,
Jacob?

Marley. It is.

Scrooge. I think I’d rather not.

Marley. Without their visits, you cannot hope to shun the
path I tread. Expect the first one tomorrow, when the bell
tolls one.

Scrooge. Couldn’t I take ’em all at once, and get it over,
Jacob?


Marley. Expect the second on the next night at the same hour.
The third upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve
has ceased to vibrate. Look to see me no more. Others may,
but you may not. And look that, for your own sake, you
remember what has passed between us!

[Marley places his head back upon his shoulders. He approaches the
window and beckons to Scrooge to watch. Outside the window,
specters fly by, carrying money-boxes and chains. They make a
confused sound of lamentation. Marley, after listening a moment,
joins into their mournful dirge. He leans to the window and floats
out into the bleak, dark night. He is gone.]

Scrooge. [Rushing to the window] Jacob! No, Jacob! Don’t
leave me! I’m frightened! [He sees that Marley has gone. He
looks outside. He pulls the shutter closed, so that the scene is
blocked from his view. All sound stops. After a pause, he re-opens
the shutter and all is quiet, as it should be on Christmas Eve.
Carolers carol out of doors, in the distance. Scrooge closes the
shutter and walks down the stairs. He examines the door by which
Marley first entered.] No one here at all! Did I imagine all that?
Humbug! [He looks about the room.] I did imagine it. It only
happened in my foulest dream-mind, didn’t it? An
undigested bit of . . . [Thunder and lightning in the room;
suddenly] Sorry! Sorry!

[There is silence again. The lights fade out.]

Scene 4

[Christmas music, choral, “Hark the Herald Angels Sing,” sung by
an onstage choir of children, spotlighted, D.C. Above, Scrooge in
his bed, dead to the world, asleep, in his darkened room. It should
appear that the choir is singing somewhere outside of the house, of
course, and a use of scrim is thus suggested. When the singing is
ended, the choir should fade out of view and Marley should fade
into view, in their place.]

Marley. [Directly to audience] From this point forth . . . I shall
be quite visible to you, but invisible to him. [Smiles] He will
feel my presence, nevertheless, for, unless my senses fail me
completely, we are—you and I—witness to the changing of a
miser: that one, my partner in life, in business, and in eternity:
that one: Scrooge. [Moves to staircase, below Scrooge] See him
now. He endeavors to pierce the darkness with his ferret
eyes.[To audience] See him, now. He listens for the hour.


[The bells toll. Scrooge is awakened and quakes as the hour
approaches one o’clock, but the bells stop their sound at the hour
of twelve.]

Scrooge. [Astonished] Midnight! Why this isn’t possible. It
was past two when I went to bed. An icicle must have gotten
into the clock’s works! I couldn’t have slept through the
whole day and far into another night. It isn’t possible that
anything has happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!
[He runs to window; unshutters same; it is night.] Night, still.
Quiet, normal for the season, cold. It is certainly not noon.
I cannot in any way afford to lose my days. Securities come
due, promissory notes, interest on investments: these are
things that happen in the daylight! [He returns to his bed.]
Was this a dream?

[Marley appears in his room. He speaks to the audience.]
Marley. You see? He does not, with faith, believe in me fully,
even still! Whatever will it take to turn the faith of a miser
from money to men?

Scrooge. Another quarter and it’ll be one and Marley’s
ghostly friends will come. [Pauses; listens] Where’s the chime
for one? [Ding, dong] A quarter past [Repeats] Half-past!
[Repeats] A quarter to it! But where’s the heavy bell of the
hour one? This is a game in which I lose my senses! Perhaps,
if I allowed myself another short doze . . .

Marley. . . . Doze, Ebenezer, doze.

[A heavy bell thuds its one ring; dull and definitely one o’clock.
There is a flash of light. Scrooge sits up, in a sudden. A hand
draws back the curtains by his bed. He sees it.]

Scrooge. A hand! Who owns it! Hello!

[Ghostly music again, but of a new nature to the play. A strange
figure stands before Scrooge—like a child, yet at the same time
like an old man: white hair, but unwrinkled skin, long, muscular
arms, but delicate legs and feet. Wears white tunic; lustrous belt
cinches waist. Branch of fresh green holly in its hand, but has its
dress trimmed with fresh summer flowers. Clear jets of light
spring from the crown of its head. Holds cap in hand. The Spirit is
called Past.]

Are you the Spirit, sir, whose coming was foretold to me?
Past. I am.

Marley. Does he take this to be a vision of his green grocer?

Scrooge. Who, and what are you?

Past. I am the Ghost of Christmas Past.
Scrooge. Long past?

Past. Your past.

Scrooge. May I ask, please, sir, what business you have here
with me?

Past. Your welfare.

Scrooge. Not to sound ungrateful, sir, and really, please do
understand that I am plenty obliged for your concern, but,
really, kind spirit, it would have done all the better for my
welfare to have been left alone altogether, to have slept
peacefully through this night.

Past. Your reclamation, then. Take heed!

Scrooge. My what?

Past. [Motioning to Scrooge and taking his arm] Rise! Fly with
me! [He leads Scrooge to the window.]

Scrooge. [Panicked] Fly, but I am a mortal and cannot fly!

Past. [Pointing to his heart] Bear but a touch of my hand here
and you shall be upheld in more than this!

[Scrooge touches the spirit’s heart and the lights dissolve into
sparkly flickers. Lovely crystals of music are heard. The scene
dissolves into another. Christmas music again]

Scene 5

[Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past walk together across
an open stage. In the background, we see a field that is open;
covered by a soft, downy snow: a country road.]

Scrooge. Good Heaven! I was bred in this place. I was a
boy here!

[Scrooge freezes, staring at the field beyond. Marley’s ghost
appears beside him; takes Scrooge’s face in his hands, and turns his
face to the audience.]

Marley. You see this Scrooge: stricken by feeling. Conscious
of a thousand odors floating in the air, each one connected
with a thousand thoughts, and hopes, and joys, and care
long, long forgotten. [Pause] This one—this Scrooge—before
your very eyes, returns to life, among the living. [To audience,
sternly] You’d best pay your most careful attention. I would
suggest rapt.

[There is a small flash and puff of smoke and Marley is gone
again.]

Past. Your lip is trembling, Mr. Scrooge. And what is that
upon your cheek?

Scrooge. Upon my cheek? Nothing . . . a blemish on the skin
from the eating of overmuch grease . . . nothing . . . [Suddenly]
Kind Spirit of Christmas Past, lead me where you will, but
quickly! To be stagnant in this place is, for me, unbearable!
Past. You recollect the way?

Scrooge. Remember it! I would know it blindfolded! My
bridge, my church, my winding river! [Staggers about, trying
to see it all at once. He weeps again.]

Past. These are but shadows of things that have been. They
have no consciousness of us.

[Four jocund travelers enter, singing a Christmas song in four-part
harmony—“God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.”]

Scrooge. Listen! I know these men! I remember the beauty of
their song!

Past. But, why do you remember it so happily? It is Merry
Christmas that they say to one another! What is Merry
Christmas to you, Mr. Scrooge? Out upon Merry Christmas,
right? What good has Merry Christmas ever done you, Mr.
Scrooge? . . .

Scrooge. [After a long pause] None. No good. None . . . [He
bows his head.]

Past. Look, you, sir, a school ahead. The schoolroom is not
quite deserted. A solitary child, neglected by his friends, is
left there still.

[Scrooge falls to the ground; sobbing as he sees, and we see, a small
boy, the young Scrooge, sitting and weeping, bravely, alone at his
desk: alone in a vast space, a void.]

Scrooge. I cannot look on him!

Past. You must, Mr. Scrooge, you must.

Scrooge. It’s me. [Pauses; weeps] Poor boy. He lived inside his
head . . . alone . . . [Pauses; weeps] poor boy. [Pauses; stops his
weeping] I wish . . . [Dries his eyes on his cuff] ah! it’s too late!
Past. What is the matter?

Scrooge. There was a boy singing a Christmas Carol outside
my door last night. I should like to have given him
something: that’s all.

Past. [Smiles; waves his hand to Scrooge] Come. Let us see
another Christmas.

[Lights out on a little boy. A flash of light. A puff of smoke. Lights
up on older boy]

Scrooge. Look! Me, again! Older now! [Realizes] Oh, yes . . .
still alone.

[The boy—a slightly older Scrooge—sits alone in a chair, reading.
The door to the room opens and a young girl enters. She is much,
much younger than this slightly older Scrooge. She is, say, six,
and he is, say, twelve. Elder Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas
Past stand watching the scene, unseen.]

Fan. Dear, dear brother, I have come to bring you home.
Boy. Home, little Fan?

Fan. Yes! Home, for good and all! Father is so much kinder
than he ever used to be, and home’s like heaven! He spoke so
gently to me one dear night when I was going to bed that I
was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come
home; and he said “yes” . . . you should; and sent me in a
coach to bring you. And you’re to be a man and are never to
come back here, but first, we’re to be together all the
Christmas long, and have the merriest time in the world.

Boy. You are quite a woman, little Fan!

[Laughing; she drags at boy, causing him to stumble to the door
with her. Suddenly we hear a mean and terrible voice in the
hallway. Off. It is the Schoolmaster.]

Schoolmaster. Bring down Master Scrooge’s travel box at
once! He is to travel!

Fan. Who is that, Ebenezer?

Boy. O! Quiet, Fan. It is the Schoolmaster, himself!

[The door bursts open and into the room bursts with it the
Schoolmaster.]

Schoolmaster. Master Scrooge?

Boy. Oh, Schoolmaster, I’d like you to meet my little sister,
Fan, sir . . .

[Two boys struggle on with Scrooge’s trunk.]

Fan. Pleased, sir . . . [She curtsies.]

Schoolmaster. You are to travel, Master Scrooge.

Scrooge. Yes, sir, I know sir . . .

[All start to exit, but Fan grabs the coattail of the mean old
Schoolmaster.]

Boy. Fan!

Schoolmaster. What’s this?

Fan. Pardon, sir, but l believe that you’ve forgotten to say
your goodbye to my brother, Ebenezer, who stands still now
awaiting it . . . [She smiles, curtsies, lowers her eyes.] pardon, sir.

Schoolmaster. [Amazed] I . . . uh . . . harumph . . . uhh . . .
well, then . . . [Outstretches hand] Goodbye, Scrooge.

Boy. Uh, well, goodbye, Schoolmaster . . .

[Lights fade out on all but Boy looking at Fan; and Scrooge and
Past looking at them.]

Scrooge. Oh, my dear, dear little sister, Fan . . . how I
loved her.

Past. Always a delicate creature, whom a breath might have
withered, but she had a large heart . . .

Scrooge. So she had.

Past. She died a woman, and had, as I think, children.

Scrooge. One child.

Past. True. Your nephew.

Scrooge. Yes.

Past. Fine, then. We move on, Mr. Scrooge. That warehouse,
there? Do you know it?

Scrooge. Know it? Wasn’t I apprenticed there?

Past. We’ll have a look.

[They enter the warehouse. The lights crossfade with them, coming
up on an old man in Welsh wig: Fezziwig.]

Scrooge. Why, it’s old Fezziwig! Bless his heart; it’s
Fezziwig, alive again!

[Fezziwig sits behind a large, high desk, counting. He lays down
his pen; looks at the clock: seven bells sound.]

Quittin’ time . . .

Fezziwig. Quittin’ time . . . [He takes off his waistcoat and
laughs: calls off] Yo ho, Ebenezer! Dick!

[Dick Wilkins and Ebenezer Scrooge—a young man version—
enter the room. Dick and Ebenezer are Fezziwig’s apprentices.]

Scrooge. Dick Wilkins, to be sure! My fellow-’prentice! Bless
my soul, yes. There he is. He was very much attached to me,
was Dick. Poor Dick! Dear, dear!

Fezziwig. Yo ho, my boys. No more work tonight. Christmas
Eve, Dick. Christmas, Ebenezer!

[They stand at attention in front of Fezziwig; laughing]

Hilli-ho! Clear away, and let’s have lots of room here! Hilli-
ho, Dick! Chirrup, Ebenezer!

[The young men clear the room, sweep the floor, straighten the
pictures, trim the lamps, etc. The space is clear now. A fiddler
enters, fiddling.]

Hi-ho, Matthew! Fiddle away . . . where are my daughters?

[The fiddler plays. Three young daughters of Fezziwig enter
followed by six young adult male suitors. They are dancing to the
music. All employees come in: workers, clerks, housemaids, cousins,
the baker, etc. All dance. Full number wanted here. Throughout the
dance, food is brought into the feast. It is “eaten” in dance, by the
dancers. Ebenezer dances with all three of the daughters, as does

Dick. They compete for the daughters, happily, in the dance.
Fezziwig dances with his daughters. Fezziwig dances with Dick
and Ebenezer. The music changes: Mrs. Fezziwig enters. She
lovingly scolds her husband. They dance. She dances with
Ebenezer, lifting him and throwing him about. She is enormously
fat. When the dance is ended, they all dance off, floating away, as
does the music. Scrooge and the Ghost of Christmas Past stand
alone now. The music is gone.]

Past. It was a small matter, that Fezziwig made those silly
folks so full of gratitude.

Scrooge. Small!

Past. Shhh!

[Lights up on Dick and Ebenezer]

Dick. We are blessed, Ebenezer, truly, to have such a master
as Mr. Fezziwig!

Young Scrooge. He is the best, best, the very and absolute
best! If ever I own a firm of my own, I shall treat my
apprentices with the same dignity and the same grace. We
have learned a wonderful lesson from the master, Dick!

Dick. Ah, that’s a fact, Ebenezer. That’s a fact!

Past. Was it not a small matter, really? He spent but a few
pounds of his mortal money on your small party. Three or
four pounds, perhaps. Is that so much that he deserves such
praise as you and Dick so lavish now?

Scrooge. It isn’t that! It isn’t that, Spirit. Fezziwig had the
power to make us happy or unhappy; to make our service
light or burdensome; a pleasure or a toil. The happiness he
gave is quite as great as if it cost him a fortune.

Past. What is the matter?

Scrooge. Nothing particular.

Past. Something, I think.

Scrooge. No, no. l should like to be able to say a word or two
to my clerk just now! That’s all!

[Ebenezer enters the room and shuts down all the lamps. He
stretches and yawns. The Ghost of Christmas Past turns to
Scrooge all of a sudden.]

Past. My time grows short! Quick!

[In a flash of light, Ebenezer is gone, and in his place stands an
Older Scrooge, this one a man in the prime of his life. Beside him
stands a young woman in a mourning dress. She is crying. She
speaks to the man, with hostility.]
Woman. It matters little . . . to you, very little. Another idol
has displaced me.

Man. What idol has displaced you?

Woman. A golden one.

Man. This is an even-handed dealing of the world. There is
nothing on which it is so hard as poverty; and there is
nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the
pursuit of wealth!

Woman. You fear the world too much. Have I not seen your
nobler aspirations fall off one by one, until the master-
passion, Gain, engrosses you? Have I not?

Scrooge. No!

Man. What then? Even if I have grown so much wiser, what
then? Have I changed towards you?

Woman. No . . .

Man. Am I?

Woman. Our contract is an old one. It was made when we
were both poor and content to be so. You are changed. When
it was made, you were another man.

Man. I was not another man: I was a boy.

Woman. Your own feeling tells you that you were not what
you are. I am. That which promised happiness when we were
one in heart is fraught with misery now that we are two . . .

Scrooge. No!

Woman. How often and how keenly I have thought of this,
I will not say. It is enough that I have thought of it, and can
release you . . .

Scrooge. [Quietly] Don’t release me, madame . . .

Man. Have I ever sought release?

Woman. In words. No. Never.

Man. In what then?

Woman. In a changed nature: in an altered spirit. In
everything that made my love of any worth or value in your
sight. If this has never been between us, tell me, would you
seek me out and try to win me now? Ah, no!

Scrooge. Ah, yes!

Man. You think not?

Woman. I would gladly think otherwise if I could, heaven
knows! But if you were free today, tomorrow, yesterday, can
even I believe that you would choose a dowerless girl—you
who in your very confidence with her weigh everything by
Gain; or, choosing her, do I not know that your repentance
and regret would surely follow? I do; and I release you. With
a full heart, for the love of him you once were.

Scrooge. Please, I . . . I . . .

Man. Please, I . . . I . . .

Woman. Please. You may—the memory of what is past half
makes me hope you will—have pain in this. A very, very brief
time, and you will dismiss the memory of it, as an
unprofitable dream, from which it happened well that you
awoke. May you be happy in the life that you have chosen for
yourself . . .

Scrooge. No!

Woman. Yourself . . . alone . . .

Scrooge. No!

Woman. Goodbye, Ebenezer . . .

Scrooge. Don’t let her go!

Man. Goodbye.

Scrooge. No!

[She exits. Scrooge goes to younger man: himself.]

You fool! Mindless loon! You fool!

Man. [To exited woman] Fool. Mindless loon. Fool . . .

Scrooge. Don’t say that! Spirit, remove me from this place.

Past. I have told you these were shadows of the things that
have been. They are what they are. Do not blame me, Mr.Scrooge.

Scrooge. Remove me! I cannot bear it!

[The faces of all who appeared in this scene are now projected for a
moment around the stage: enormous, flimsy, silent.]

Leave me! Take me back! Haunt me no longer!

[There is a sudden flash of light: a flare. The Ghost of Christmas
Past is gone. Scrooge is, for the moment, alone onstage. His bed is
turned down, across the stage. A small candle burns now in
Scrooge’s hand. There is a child’s cap in his other hand. He slowly
crosses the stage to his bed, to sleep. Marley appears behind
Scrooge, who continues his long, elderly cross to bed. Marley
speaks directly to the audience.]

Marley. Scrooge must sleep now. He must surrender to the
irresistible drowsiness caused by the recognition of what
was. [Pauses] The cap he carries is from ten lives past: his
boyhood cap . . . donned atop a hopeful hairy head . . .
askew, perhaps, or at a rakish angle. Doffed now in honor of
regret. Perhaps even too heavy to carry in his present state
of weak remorse . . .

[Scrooge drops the cap. He lies atop his bed. He sleeps. To
audience]

He sleeps. For him, there’s even more trouble ahead. [Smiles]
For you? The play house tells me there’s hot cider, as should
be your anticipation for the specter Christmas Present and
Future, for I promise you both. [Smiles again] So, I pray you
hurry back to your seats refreshed and ready for a miser—to
turn his coat of gray into a blazen Christmas holly-red. [A
flash of lightning. A clap of thunder. Bats fly. Ghosty music.
Marley is gone.]
