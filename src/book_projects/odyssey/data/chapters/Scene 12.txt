SCENE 12:
NARRATOR 2: Late that evening, Odysseus prepares to bathe before bedtime. 
NARRATOR 1: An old nurse pours hot water into a tub for him.  
EURYKLEIA: I have been here at this palace for many years. I was in the room when Odysseus himself was born and received him in my arms before his own mother did.  
ODYSSEUS: Kind woman, you have been of great service to this household. 
EURYKLEIA: I even raised up young Telemachus. The misery I have seen in this home since the master left so many years ago for Troy to fight! All because of a woman named Helen! My lady’s heart is weary. 
ODYSSEUS: Tomorrow will be the end of her sorrows. 
NARRATOR 2: The old woman looks up from her work and notices a scar on Odysseus’ knee. She jumps back and looks into his eyes. 
EURYKLEIA: Only one person could have a scar like that. How did you get that scar? 
ODYSSEUS: A wild boar tore into my leg when I was young. 
EURYKLEIA: You were on a hunt with your father . . . Odysseus? Odysseus! Great Zeus, we have been delivered! 
NARRATOR 1: Eurykleia throws her arms around Odysseus and welcomes him home. 
ODYSSEUS: Come, dear lady, let me tell you how you can help us with our plan. (They exit.)
